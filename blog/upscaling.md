# How I Upscaled 12 Images 10X Without Melting My Mac

Look, I love a good image. You love a good image. Everyone loves a good image—except maybe my MacBook, which begins hyperventilating the moment I suggest anything more CPU-intensive than opening a spreadsheet.

So when I realized I needed to upscale 12 images by *ten freaking times*—some of them `.jpg`, some `.webp`, all of them looking like they’d been pulled from a dial-up internet connection in 2003—I braced for impact.

Spoiler: I survived. So did my Mac. Barely. Here’s how.

## The Problem: 12 Tiny Blurry Dreams

I had a dozen images that looked like they were shot on a potato. Some `.jpg`, some `.webp`. And I needed them sharp. Like, **"printed on a billboard in Times Square while people squint in admiration"** sharp.

But upscaling images is often code for "ruin the pixels while making them bigger." It’s like taking a small blurry dog and blowing it up into a big blurry bear. Cute? Maybe. Useful? Not at all.

I needed a solution. Fast. Preferably one that didn’t require a GPU that costs more than rent.

## The Secret Weapon: [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl)

Enter **[Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl)**, the free, open-source desktop app built specifically to upscale images using AI. It's like the Photoshop of the future but without the Adobe price tag and popups begging you to try Lightroom.

Even better—it works on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**, so no one’s left out (not even you, weird Arch Linux guy).

Download it. Open it. Select a folder. Click a button. Watch magic happen. Upscayl turns sad little images into glorious, hi-res, ultra-crisp masterpieces.

## The Actual Process (aka "What I Did Instead of Crying")

1. **Download Upscayl** from the [official GitHub releases page](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/releases). Pick the macOS `.dmg` file if you’re rocking Apple silicon like me.

2. **Install it** like a civilized person (drag to Applications).

3. **Open Upscayl** and immediately forgive it for not having the prettiest interface. We’re here for function, not fashion.

4. Select **“Batch Upscale”**.

5. Dump all 12 images (yep, `.webp` too) into one folder and point Upscayl at it.

6. Choose the **“Real-ESRGAN 4x Plus”** model. Then hit the “Upscale” button *twice*—because 4x + 4x = 16x, which is basically 10x but with more pizzazz.

7. **Wait**. Not long. Maybe enough time to make a cup of tea, question your life choices, and come back.

8. Bask in the glory of your crisp, dreamy 10X images.

## Pro Tips (Because I Learned These the Hard Way)

- **.webp is accepted!** You don’t need to convert them first. Upscayl treats `.webp` and `.jpg` with equal respect, like a true digital diplomat.

- If you want **exactly** 10X upscaling, you can always do one 4x pass, then another 2.5x using a different tool like [BigJPG](https://bigjpg.com/)—but honestly, the double 4x pass is so sharp you might not care about the math.

- Don’t try to use this while running a 74-tab Chrome session, Blender, and a Zoom call with your boss. Your Mac will emit a sound you’ve never heard before, and it might be a cry for help.

## Why I Love Upscayl (And Why You Might Too)

- It’s free.
- It’s fast.
- It supports batch processing.
- It doesn’t roast your CPU like a rotisserie chicken.
- The results are *chef’s kiss* level.

Seriously, I compared it to several paid upscalers and Upscayl held its own like a budget action hero in a Marvel movie. You think it’ll die in Act I, but nope—by the end, it’s carrying the franchise.

And hey—if this was helpful or at least gave you a chuckle while your image was rendering, **follow me**. I’m always doing weird, semi-useful, slightly chaotic tech experiments and oversharing the results.

**Art Prompt:**

An ethereal garden scene at sunrise, featuring shimmering water lilies on a quiet pond. Use soft, feathery brush strokes reminiscent of early French Impressionism. Mist hovers low across the surface, with dappled light filtering through delicate willow branches. The colors should feel dreamlike—pastels and pale golds with hints of lavender. Focus on atmosphere and light play, avoiding hard edges. Capture movement in the water and leaves, as if everything is gently stirring awake.
