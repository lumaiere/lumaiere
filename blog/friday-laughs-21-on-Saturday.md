# Friday Night Laughs: Why Your Tech is "Totally" Secure

Ah, another glorious Friday night—a time for laughter, relaxation, and, of course, reflecting on why your tech solution is *definitely* secure. Because if you can't laugh about cybersecurity, can you really say you've lived? Let’s dive into tonight’s dose of hilarity, guaranteed to make your firewall blush.

**Joke 1:**
Why don’t hackers use strong passwords?

Because “123456” is easier to spell than “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”.

---

**Joke 2:**
What did the tech company say when they installed a new security system?

“Don’t worry, it’s 100% secure. Just don’t plug it in.”

---

**Joke 3:**
Why did the cybersecurity expert go broke?

Because he cleared his cookies every day.

---

**Limerick:**
There once was a server so slow,  
Its security made the team glow.  
But a hacker named Chuck,  
With a stroke of good luck,  
Found the password was “admin”—oh no!

---

**Joke 4:**
How do you know your IT department loves you?

They keep sending you emails with the subject line: “Congratulations! You won…” just to see if you’ll click.

---

**Joke 5:**
Why did the encryption algorithm break up with its partner?

It found out they were plaintext.

---

**Rhyming Poem:**
Your firewall’s tall, your passwords are strong,  
Your system’s in place, nothing can go wrong.  
But as you sit smug, so safe and secure,  
Remember: updates are the best kind of cure.  
Hackers are lurking, they’re fast and they’re mean,  
Don’t let your “safe” turn to “should have seen.”

**Joke 6:**
Why did the cloud server refuse to share its data?

Because it’s on a strictly “need-to-cloud” basis.

---

**Joke 7:**
How do you make a programmer’s day?

Tell them their code is unhackable. Then watch them laugh, cry, and immediately rewrite everything.

---

**Art Prompt:**
Create a masterpiece featuring a futuristic cyber fortress atop a glowing mountain, surrounded by cascading waterfalls of binary code, with armored knights wielding glowing shields of encryption and swords forged from firewalls. The sky should be ablaze with vibrant, ethereal hues, hinting at an AI-crafted utopia. This artwork should exude the allure of rarity and the grandeur of a collectible worth millions.
