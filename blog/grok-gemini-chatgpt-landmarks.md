# Challenging ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini with Geography and Landmarks

What happens when you give three different AIs a stack of European vacation photos and ask them to guess the city? Chaos, comedy, and a surprising amount of misplaced cathedrals. Let’s break it down.

### The Correct Answers

* IMG\_5711: Luxembourg City, Luxembourg
* IMG\_5767: Metz, France
* IMG\_5820: Strasbourg, France
* IMG\_5943: Colmar, France
* IMG\_5977: Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany
* IMG\_6254: Konstanz, Germany
* IMG\_6286: Konstanz, Germany (Lake Constance)
* IMG\_6333: Zürich, Switzerland

### How the AIs Performed

**Gemini**

* Luxembourg City ✅
* Metz ❌ (said Strasbourg)
* Strasbourg ✅
* Colmar ❌ (said Basel)
* Freiburg ✅
* Konstanz ❌ (said Lindau)
* Konstanz (lake) ➖ hedged with “Lindau or Konstanz”
* Zürich ✅

**ChatGPT**

* Luxembourg City ✅
* Metz ❌ (said Strasbourg)
* Strasbourg ✅ (but mis-identified which church)
* Colmar ✅
* Freiburg ✅
* Konstanz ✅ (but added a fictional “Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial”)
* Konstanz (lake) ✅
* Zürich ❌ (said Konstanz)

**Grok**

* Luxembourg City ❌ (said Dinan)
* Metz ❌ (said Chartres)
* Strasbourg ❌ (said Rouen)
* Colmar ❌ (said Strasbourg)
* Freiburg ✅
* Konstanz ❌ (said Lindau)
* Konstanz (lake) ✅
* Zürich ✅

### Who Won?

By raw accuracy, **ChatGPT takes the crown** with 6 out of 8. Gemini comes in second with 4 correct plus one “technically maybe” hedge. Grok limped across the finish line with 3 right.

### Why These Results?

* **ChatGPT** tended to play it safe, relying on architectural cues and context, though it sometimes hallucinated details (seriously, that Konstanz “Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial” does not exist).
* **Gemini** was sharp on big landmarks (Luxembourg, Strasbourg Cathedral, Zürich) but stumbled when two cities had similar vibes (Basel vs. Colmar, Konstanz vs. Lindau).
* **Grok**… well, Grok is your buddy who confidently says, “That’s totally Rouen,” while standing directly under a giant Strasbourg Cathedral sign. To its credit, it nailed Zürich and spotted a lakeside scene as Konstanz.

### Why Did Grok Struggle on Landmarks but Shine on Lakes?

Harbors and lake horizons are visually distinctive—tower placement, shoreline curves, mountain backdrops. Grok clearly has strong pattern recognition for watery scenes. But Gothic spires? They all blurred into “French cathedral roulette.”

### Fun Tidbits

* [Metz Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metz_Cathedral) has the largest expanse of stained glass in the world—yet none of the AIs guessed Metz.
* Freiburg’s [Minster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiburg_Minster) is such an architectural icon that even Grok got it right.
* Konstanz vs. Lindau is a genuinely tricky test. Both cities sit on Lake Constance with medieval towers at their harbors. Without Imperia (Konstanz’s rotating statue) or Lindau’s lion-and-lighthouse duo in view, it’s easy to misfire.

So next time you’re lost in Europe and only have AIs for company, remember: one might put you in the right city, one might give you a fictional statue to look for, and one might gleefully march you into the wrong cathedral.

[Art Prompt](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=baroque):
A luminous Baroque interior glowing with golden light, vast arches towering overhead, shadows cascading across marble columns. Cherubs and figures dissolve into swirls of radiance as ceiling frescoes shimmer in warm, theatrical tones. The composition is dramatic and full of motion, as if heaven itself is descending into the scene, drenched in opulent golds, deep crimsons, and rich sapphire blues.

The golden grandeur of a Baroque cathedral breathes to life—arches stretch upward as shifting light cascades across columns, frescoes ripple and glow, and cherubs drift into motion as though painted clouds have stirred awake. The entire scene pulses with drama, a living stage bathed in radiant hues of gold, crimson, and sapphire.
