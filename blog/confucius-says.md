**Confucius Says... And Other Words of Wisdom from Fortune Cookies**

Let’s be honest—some of the best life advice isn’t found in self-help books, TED Talks, or deep philosophical discussions. No, it’s hidden inside a golden-brown, snap-worthy, sometimes-too-stale fortune cookie. These bite-sized nuggets of wisdom, printed on tiny scraps of paper, hold the power to inspire, confuse, and sometimes, make us question our very existence.

### The Ancient Art of Cookie Wisdom

Legend has it that Confucius himself once said, *"Man who stands on toilet is high on pot."* Okay, maybe that wasn’t Confucius. But if it were, wouldn’t that be the kind of universal truth worthy of being enshrined in a fortune cookie?

Some believe these cookies originated in China, but the truth is they are as Chinese as deep-dish pizza is Italian. The modern fortune cookie, with its crisp exterior and cryptic messages, was actually popularized in California in the early 20th century. Yet, the appeal of their mysterious messages transcends all cultures—because let’s face it, we all want to know our “fortune” while digesting our lo mein.

### Classic Fortune Cookie Wisdom

If you’ve cracked open enough cookies in your lifetime, you’ll notice they typically fall into a few distinct categories:

#### 1. **The Motivational Masterpieces**
These fortunes read like they were ghostwritten by a life coach with a caffeine addiction:

- *"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."*
- *"Your talents will be recognized and rewarded."*
- *"Happiness is not something you find, it’s something you create."*

These are the ones that make you temporarily believe you should quit your job and become a painter in the south of France.

#### 2. **The Mysteriously Vague Prophecies**
Some fortunes feel like they were crafted by a mystical being who doesn’t want to commit to specifics:

- *"You will have a pleasant surprise."*
- *"A great opportunity is coming your way."*
- *"Good things will happen to you soon."*

Thanks for the heads-up, O Wise Cookie. Should I buy a lottery ticket or just brace for impact?

#### 3. **The Fortune That Isn’t a Fortune**
We’ve all been there—eagerly cracking open our cookie, expecting wisdom, only to be handed... a fact.

- *"People born in March are optimistic."*
- *"Beef and broccoli is a healthy choice."*
- *"You will have dessert."* (Well, duh—I just ate a fortune cookie.)

#### 4. **The Ones That Sound Deep but Make No Sense**
These fortunes are the Zen koans of the takeout world. The words sound profound, but upon further reflection, you realize your brain has been bamboozled.

- *"Only when the wind stops blowing does the leaf realize how much it depended on it."*
- *"The wise man is the one who knows he does not know."*
- *"The best way to catch a butterfly is to stop chasing it."*

Um, okay, Confucius. So should I just sit here and wait for a butterfly to land on me, or...?

### The Unfortunate Fortunes

Sometimes, the fortune cookie gods decide to have a little fun at your expense:

- *"You will soon be hungry again."* (Too real.)
- *"Help! I am trapped in a fortune cookie factory!"* (I mean… should we call someone?)
- *"You have a secret admirer. (Just kidding.)"* (Rude.)

The soft brushstrokes blend warm, glowing light with gentle pastel hues, capturing an ethereal atmosphere. The cookies appear to be slightly cracked open, with tiny slips of paper fluttering in the air, as if revealing ancient secrets. The overall composition has a dreamlike quality, reminiscent of Monet’s water lilies, with a delicate play of light and reflection on a lacquered surface.
