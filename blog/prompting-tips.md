# A Couple AI Prompting Tricks That Save a Ton of Time

Let’s be honest: sometimes working with AI feels like trying to argue with your GPS. You *know* that left turn will land you in a river, but the voice insists “turn left now.” I once had an AI tell me a regex matched a string when it obviously didn’t. It even “highlighted” the matching characters. Spoiler: the highlighted characters didn’t match anything except my rising blood pressure.

After a lengthy debate where the AI swore it was right, I finally said: “Alright, buddy, let’s test it.” We did. The AI instantly realized it had been hallucinating like a Victorian poet on absinthe. The truth? Testing is the fastest referee. Instead of endless arguing, hit the keyboard, run the test, and watch reality slap theory back into place.

Another time, I asked for a step-by-step solution to a gnarly problem. The AI, bless its digital heart, gave me a 12-step novel. I got stuck at step two, scrolling through what looked like IKEA instructions translated from Klingon. That’s when I switched tactics: “Give me one step at a time, and wait for my response.”

It worked. One step, I try it, report back, then the next step. Suddenly, the AI wasn’t a hyperactive instructor throwing 200 PowerPoint slides at me—it was a patient tutor spoon-feeding wisdom. I went from bogged-down frustration to actually solving the problem. Fast.

So, two tricks:

1. **Stop arguing. Test it.** Nothing cuts through hallucinations faster than real output.
2. **One step at a time.** Don’t let the AI overwhelm you with an instruction buffet when you just need an appetizer.

Both will save you time, sanity, and possibly your keyboard from being frisbee’d across the room.

By the way, for a short while, our art prompts will lean toward the **Renaissance**. That era wasn’t about AI hallucinations—it was about rediscovering perspective, symmetry, anatomy, and light. Think balanced compositions, realistic human figures, and a divine obsession with harmony. A good reminder that sometimes slowing down, step by step, creates timeless results.

A grand interior scene flooded with golden light, where arches rise toward a luminous dome. Figures in flowing garments stand in balanced poses, their faces calm yet intense, painted with meticulous attention to proportion. Warm earth tones blend with rich reds and blues, while distant landscapes peek through open windows, evoking both serenity and grandeur. The brushwork is precise, the perspective mathematically flawless, and the overall mood one of reverence and timeless harmony.

Begin with sunlight spilling across an ornate hall, slowly panning upward to soaring arches that glow in warm radiance. Figures turn gracefully as if frozen mid-thought, garments flowing in slow motion with subtle ripples of fabric. The camera drifts through the dome, then out through open windows revealing soft landscapes in golden haze. The motion is smooth, reverent, and cinematic, evoking awe while blending serenity with quiet majesty.
