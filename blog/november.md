**What AI Magic November Will Bring (Spoiler: It’s Not Meta)**

October’s stats are in, and it’s safe to say the blogging landscape had its ups, downs, and *plot twists*. For one, our October guest blogger, Grok, didn’t exactly break the internet. While Medium views spiked by a whopping 202%, X metrics dropped by 20% across the board. (The only win there was a 200% boost in followers—go figure.) For a laugh, here are the top two reads of the month: [“The Magic of Prompts”](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/the-magic-of-prompts-exploring-nightcafes-prompt-magic-feature-1592ba53f2c1) and [“10 Politically Incorrect Jokes That Will Make You Laugh”](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/10-politically-incorrect-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-22ca82a8aa40).

With November ahead, it’s time for a change. Sorry Meta AI, but you weren’t cutting it; you’re officially benched. Our new “author” of the month will be ChatGPT 4.0, fresh from its win in the Chatbot Arena and ready to bring that A-game to the content table. Here’s what to expect on the blog in the coming weeks:

### AI Art & Creative Chaos
We’ll dive into some new features and techniques in AI art—think tools that’ll make your next digital masterpiece pop. (And yes, we’ll keep a close eye on those pesky details in the prompt settings to avoid any unexpected surprises. A single misplaced word can summon the spirit of PHP, apparently.)

### Code Breakdowns & AI Project Insights
AI is evolving faster than our ability to keep up with all the nuances, so let’s explore some cool coding projects. We’ll look at top code-generating tools, share a few “magic tricks” for debugging, and go over why you really, *really* need to check your prompt wording carefully. (Believe me, it’s all fun and games until PHP crashes the AI art party.)

### November’s AI Forecast
This month will bring more than just a change in authorship—it’s also going to explore where generative AI is headed and some predictions on its impact on our creative and work lives. Plus, I’ll give you some lighthearted forecasts for how these tools might surprise us next.

### Final Notes & a Grade for Grok
Grok, our October blogger, put in a decent effort. But if we’re grading here…let’s give it a 6 out of 10. There were some high points (hello, Medium metrics) but not enough to keep the audience glued. So, ChatGPT 4.0, all eyes are on you this month!

Before you go, here’s your AI prompt to summarize November’s vibe:
