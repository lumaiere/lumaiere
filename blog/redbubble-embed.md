# How to Embed Your Redbubble Portfolio on WordPress Without Losing Your Mind  

So, you've got a stunning Redbubble store filled with glorious designs that deserve to be showcased to the world. Naturally, you want to embed that store directly onto your WordPress site. Easy, right? Well, let’s just say that WordPress can be… *particular* when it comes to embedding scripts.  

Fear not! This guide will walk you through the process with humor, clarity, and just a smidge of existential dread when dealing with WordPress quirks.  

## Step 1: Grab the Embed Code  

First, log in to your Redbubble account and copy your external portfolio embed code. It should look something like this:  

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.redbubble.com/assets/external_portfolio.js"></script>
<script id="rb-xzfcxvzx" type="text/javascript">new RBExternalPortfolio('www.redbubble.com', 'yourusername', 2, 2).renderIframe();</script>
```  

Your Redbubble username replaces `'yourusername'`, and the numbers at the end (`2,2`) determine the grid layout. Change them to get a different number of columns and rows.  

## Step 2: Where the Script Should (and Shouldn’t) Go  

WordPress is a control freak. It doesn’t just let you throw JavaScript anywhere you please. Here are three methods to get it working:  

### **Method 1: The Classic Text Widget Approach**  
1. Navigate to **Appearance > Widgets** in your WordPress dashboard.  
2. Drag a **Custom HTML Widget** to the area where you want the store to appear (like a sidebar or footer).  
3. Paste your embed code into the widget and click **Save**.  

This works fine for some themes, but certain WordPress setups might block external scripts. If that happens, don’t panic—read on.  

### **Method 2: Embedding the Code in a Page or Post**  
1. Open a new or existing post/page.  
2. Switch to the **Code Editor** (or use the Custom HTML block in Gutenberg).  
3. Paste the embed code.  
4. Preview the page—if it works, congrats! If not, we fight harder.  

### **Method 3: Using a Code Snippet Plugin (Best for Stubborn Themes)**  
1. Install the **Insert Headers and Footers** plugin.  
2. Go to **Settings > Insert Headers and Footers**.  
3. Paste your Redbubble script inside the **Footer Scripts** section.  
4. Save your changes.  
5. Now, go to your page and add this simple `<div>` to the **Custom HTML Block** where you want the portfolio to appear:  

   ```html
   <div id="rb-xzfcxvzx"></div>
   ```  

This ensures WordPress doesn’t strip out your JavaScript, and Redbubble loads correctly.  

## Common Issues & Fixes  

**Problem:** The embed doesn’t show up.  
**Fix:** Try **Method 3** above—WordPress sometimes blocks inline scripts for security reasons.  

**Problem:** It looks tiny.  
**Fix:** Use CSS to force a larger iframe:  

```css
iframe { width: 100%; height: 600px; }
```  

**Problem:** Your theme is too restrictive.  
**Fix:** Some themes simply *hate* JavaScript embeds. Try a plugin like **WPCode** to add the script manually.  

## Final Thoughts  

Now that you’ve successfully embedded your Redbubble store, it’s time to sit back, admire your work, and wait for the sweet sound of *cha-ching!* as those sales roll in.

### **Art Prompt:**  
A dreamlike riverscape at twilight, where the sky melts into the water with delicate, feathery brushstrokes. The scene is awash with warm hues of rose, ochre, and deep cerulean, reflecting a golden glow off rippling currents. In the foreground, shadowy figures drift along in wooden boats, their forms softened by the hazy mist. The trees lining the shore are rendered in quick, expressive strokes, capturing the fleeting dance of light and shadow. The entire composition feels as if it were a memory captured mid-dissolve—vibrant yet ephemeral, a symphony of color and movement.
