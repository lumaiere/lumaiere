**May Recap, June Plans, and a Little June 1 History for Dessert**

Well, well, well… May, you unpredictable beast. While sales decided to nap, everything else threw a rave.

Let’s start with the glow-ups. LumAIere.com saw a 63% boost in page views. Blog views rose 38%. Users? Up 70%. That’s not growth, that’s a spring awakening. The homepage reigned supreme: [lumaiere.com](https://lumaiere.com/), followed closely by the gallery at [lumaiere.com/?gallery=video](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=video). Seems like video wasn’t just a feature—it was the party.

And speaking of parties—Medium danced right alongside. Views were up 23%, reads up 26%. Followers held steady (no one unfollowed, so we’ll call it a win). The top performer was still the API brawl royale: [Swagger vs. ReDoc: The Ultimate Showdown of API Documentation Titans](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/swagger-vs-redoc-the-ultimate-showdown-of-api-documentation-titans-6424e5967538). And in second place, holding strong from last month, the giggle grenade: [10 Politically Incorrect Jokes That Will Make You Laugh](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/10-politically-incorrect-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-22ca82a8aa40).

Over on Facebook, it was chaos in a lab coat. Views? Up 45%. Reach? Down 1%. New followers exploded by 450%, but interactions fell 50%, and clicks dropped 67%. Still, with visits up 1500%, we’ll call that a successful identity crisis. The video intro post led the charge: [New artwork is live and more is dropping soon](https://www.facebook.com/reel/712114034649753), followed by the architecture roast: [Spaghetti architecture](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1015104967437148).

X.com had its own moment. Impressions were up 20%, likes up 67%, engagements up 58%, and new followers jumped 200%. Most viewed was April’s therapy session: [April Recap - Ever feel like April hit you with a banana in one hand and a rocket launch in the other?](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1918136686392856584), followed by the visual metaphor showdown: [Swagger is a rock concert. ReDoc is a string quartet in a red velvet room.](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1926648498293747725).

Enter TikTok. Brand new as of May 12 and already acting like it owns the place. The top viewed and most liked post? Enlightenment set to Falco: [Enlightenment with Falco's Rock Me Amadeus](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7508070679049162014). The runner-up in views: [blog.lumaiere.com with ATLXS's PASSO BEM SOLTO - slowed](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7510649538550582558), and second-most liked was the Baroque drop: [Baroque and Loaded with Falco](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7508945357347228959).

So, what changed? Let’s not overlook the obvious: the launch of video across platforms. TikTok launched. Facebook added video posts. LumAIere.com featured new video galleries. The numbers lit up in sync. Coincidence? Probably not. Video didn’t just boost engagement—it made everything sparkle.

Now for June. Expect more from “The Creators” and “The Software Methodology” series—possibly with even more absurd analogies and time-traveling humor. We’re also leaving space open for any random inspiration that hits like a jazz solo in a subway station.

And now, because this post is 99% vibes and 1% historical context…

**Today in History (June 1):**

* In 1495, a monk in Bavaria produced the first recorded batch of beer using hops. Modern craft brewers owe him at least one awkward festival toast.
* 1792: Kentucky became the 15th U.S. state. Horses and bourbon rejoiced.
* In 1967, The Beatles released *Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band*. Reality hasn’t been the same since.
* In 1980, CNN launched. So did 24/7 anxiety.
* 2009: Google Wave was unveiled. Then it promptly drowned.
* Marilyn Monroe was born on June 1, 1926. And somehow, she's still referenced more than most living celebrities.
* And for AI nerds: on June 1, 2015, OpenAI didn’t exist yet—but you could feel it coming in the wires.

Let’s make June just as electric. Leave a comment, drop a follow, and if you’ve got ideas for future topics—absurd, artistic, or analytical—toss 'em in.

**Art Prompt:**
A kaleidoscopic arrangement of fragmented figures and twisted geometry, where guitars, faces, and bottles fold into one another in sharp planes and layered transparencies. Earthy browns, soft ochres, muted grays, and charcoal blacks dominate the palette, punctuated by rare flecks of cerulean or crimson. The composition feels both analytical and musical, as if a jazz riff were turned into shattered glass and reassembled with mathematical precision. Each element appears both flat and dimensional—disorienting, yet harmoniously structured. The mood is intellectual, mysterious, and quietly intense, evoking a quiet room filled with the hum of abstraction.

**[Video Prompt:](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7511109295988116767)**
Begin with a slow, dramatic zoom into a still life scene that's been fractured into interlocking shards—bottles, eyes, and instruments twisting into place. Use angular transitions and sharp cuts to mimic shifting perspectives, with shapes rotating and morphing like a visual puzzle. Overlay moody ambient music or low jazz to match the earthy, cerebral atmosphere. Subtle flashes of crimson and cerulean should animate key elements rhythmically—like a guitar vibrating or an eye blinking—then dissolve into smoky gray. Finish with a layered pullback, revealing the full, surreal cubist world in motion, held in perfect asymmetrical balance.
