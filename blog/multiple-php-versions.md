# Mastering Multiple PHP Versions on GoDaddy's Web Hosting Plus Expand Plan

So, you've decided to host multiple websites on GoDaddy's Web Hosting Plus Expand plan, and each site insists on a different PHP version. It's like hosting a dinner party where one guest demands vegan sushi, another craves a well-done steak, and someone else just wants a bowl of cereal. Fear not! With a pinch of humor and a dash of tech wisdom, let's navigate this culinary—err, coding adventure together.

## Understanding the Playground

GoDaddy's Web Hosting Plus offers the simplicity of cPanel combined with the power of a virtual private server (VPS). It's ideal for sites that have outgrown their baby shoes and are now stomping around in big boots.

## The PHP Conundrum

Each of your websites has its own personality and, consequently, its own PHP version preference. One's clinging to PHP 5.6 like it's a vintage wine, while another is sprinting ahead with PHP 8.1. How do you keep them all happy under one roof?

## The .htaccess Magic Trick

Enter the `.htaccess` file—your secret weapon. By adding a few lines to this file in each site's directory, you can dictate which PHP version it should use. Here's how:

1. **Navigate to Your Site's Directory:** Use File Manager, FTP, or SSH to access the specific site's folder.

2. **Edit or Create the .htaccess File:** If there's already a `.htaccess` file, open it. If not, create a new one.

3. **Add the PHP Handler:** Insert the following line to specify the PHP version. For example, to set PHP 7.3:

   ```
   AddHandler application/x-httpd-alt-php73___lsphp .php
   ```

   Replace `php73` with your desired version, like `php56` for PHP 5.6 or `php81` for PHP 8.1.

4. **Save and Test:** Save the `.htaccess` file and check your site to ensure everything's running smoothly.

## A Word of Caution

While this method is nifty, it's like juggling flaming torches—exciting but potentially hazardous. Incorrect configurations can lead to site errors. Always back up your `.htaccess` file before making changes. If things go south, you'll have a safety net.

## Extended PHP Support: The Safety Blanket

Running an older PHP version? GoDaddy offers Extended PHP Support, providing security patches for outdated versions. It's like having a security guard for your vintage wine cellar.

## The Grand Finale

Managing multiple PHP versions on a single hosting plan might seem like herding cats, but with the right approach, it's entirely doable. By leveraging the `.htaccess` file and GoDaddy's Extended PHP Support, you can keep each of your sites purring along with their preferred PHP versions.
