### **Make Sure to Count Digits and Limbs**

Well, September's off to a roaring start, isn't it? Between Gemini and Gemini Advanced ghosting me faster than a bad date and my AI art looking like it escaped from a Picasso fever dream, I'm *this* close to throwing in the towel and becoming a hermit.

But before I retreat to a cave, let's talk about the elephant in the room â€” or should I say, the six-legged horse in the room?

Why, oh why, can't AI seem to grasp the concept of basic human (or animal) anatomy? I've had to discard more masterpieces than I care to admit, all because of some extra limbs or digits that decided to crash the party.

I mean, I get it. AI is still learning. It's like a toddler trying to figure out how to use a fork. But seriously, how hard can it be to count to five? Or ten? Or, you know, however many limbs the creature is *supposed* to have?

It's gotten to the point where I've started keeping a tally. Three-armed humans? Check. Six-legged horses? You betcha. A spider with twelve legs? Oh, honey, you haven't seen anything yet.

And don't even get me started on fingers and toes. It's like they're multiplying like rabbits. One minute you've got a perfectly normal hand, the next it's sprouting extra digits like it's auditioning for a role in *The Addams Family*.

At this point, I'm half-expecting my AI art to start developing its own language, complete with extra vowels and consonants to accommodate all those extra body parts.

But hey, maybe that's the beauty of it all. Maybe AI art is just a reflection of our own imperfections, a reminder that even the most advanced technology can still make silly mistakes.

Or maybe, just maybe, it's a sign that we need to slow down and appreciate the little things. Like the fact that we have two arms, two legs, and ten fingers. Most of the time, anyway.

So next time you're admiring a piece of AI art, take a moment to count the limbs and digits. You might be surprised at what you find. And if you see something a little...off, just remember, it's all part of the fun.
