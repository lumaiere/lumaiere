**Friday Night Laughs #27: Government Giggles Edition**

Ah, governmentsâ€”the gift that keeps on taxing. Whether theyâ€™re regulating your snacks or spending millions to study the sleeping habits of squirrels, they never fail to provide a little *unintentional* comedy. So, letâ€™s celebrate the worldâ€™s most bureaucratic jokesters with some actual intentional laughs!

---

**1.** Why donâ€™t politicians ever play hide and seek?  
Because good luck hiding when youâ€™ve got a history of shady deals, and good luck seeking when government paperwork takes 6-8 weeks to process.

---

**2.** A government employee walks into a bar.  
The bartender asks, "Why the long face?"  
"Budget cuts," he sighs. "Now I can only waste *half* my time."

---

**3.** Whatâ€™s the difference between a government bond and a politicianâ€™s promise?  
One matures.

---

**4.** I told my senator I wanted to be a politician when I grow up.  
He laughed and said, "Make up your mind, kidâ€”you canâ€™t do both."

---

**5.** A citizen asked a government official, "Can you explain your job in a single sentence?"  
"Sure. My job is to find the simplest solution to any problem and then outlaw it."

---

**6.** If con is the opposite of pro, then what is the opposite of progress?  
Congress.

---

**7.** A man goes to the DMV to renew his license.  
Clerk: "Take a number and have a seat."  
Man: "But the room is empty?"  
Clerk: "Doesn't matter. You still need to wait an hour for us to tell you that you brought the wrong form."

**A Poetic Bureaucratic Disaster**

There once was a man in D.C.,  
Whose logic defied you and me.  
He spent all our cash,  
And left in a flash,  
Now he teaches "finance" for free!

---

**A Government-Inspired Limerick**

A mayor who tried to be clever,  
Passed laws that would last us forever.  
Then one day he tripped,  
And his rules all got flipped,  
Now jaywalkingâ€™s legalâ€”how *clever*!

---

**Art Prompt**  
A timeless masterpiece depicting a grand auction, where wealthy collectors in extravagant suits bid fiercely for a surreal painting of a bureaucratic maze made of golden paper stacks, each page stamped with government insignias. In the center, a bemused artist in a tattered suit watches as his work, once ignored, now fetches millions. The scene is illuminated with warm, opulent lighting, capturing the irony of art and power.
