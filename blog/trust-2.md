**Trust Issues Part 2: So Many Questions, So Few Lawyers in Capes**

Welcome back, my fiscally curious comrades. Your questions were sharper than a trustee’s pencil, and today we’re tackling them all—rapid-fire Q\&A style, minus the legalese and plus a few spicy jokes.

---

**"How much would I expect to spend setting up a trust if I have a million dollars?"**

Not as much as you think—and definitely not a million. In most states, setting up a **basic revocable living trust** will cost between **\$1,500 and \$3,000** if done through an estate planning attorney. That’s about what you’d pay for a moderately pretentious espresso machine that *doesn’t* protect your house from probate.

If you want more complex trust features (think: multi-generational clauses, asset protection, or “don’t give Jimmy the money until he’s stopped buying NFTs”), you might be looking at **\$5,000 to \$10,000**.

---

**"What if I had a billion dollars?"**

First, call me. We’re starting a podcast.

Second, with that kind of wealth, you’ll need a trust that looks like a Swiss watch on the inside. You’re talking about **layered trusts**, **irrevocable dynasties**, **SLATs**, **GRATs**, maybe even a trust within a trust (Inception-style). Expect to spend **\$20,000 to \$100,000+** in legal and financial planning fees—but it’s pennies on the billion-dollar scale.

Bonus: at that level, you don’t hire an attorney. You hire a *team* that includes attorneys, tax strategists, investment advisors, and probably a guy who only talks to your guy.

---

**"Is it a flat rate? Hourly? Asset-based? Psychic prediction?"**

Estate attorneys typically use **flat fees** for standard revocable trusts. That’s ideal—no surprises, no hourly invoice for every phone call that starts with “Just one quick question…”

For complex or custom setups, some lawyers charge **hourly rates** (\$200–\$800/hr), while others use **tiered pricing** based on the complexity of your assets. But no legit firm bases its pricing *directly* on how much you’re worth—that’s what con artists and exes do.

---

**"Tell me more about revocable vs. irrevocable trusts?"**

Ah yes, the legal version of “Choose your fighter.”

* **Revocable Trusts**: Think “edit mode.” You can change it, cancel it, reassign assets, even rename it to something like “The Spicy Taco Trust” just for fun. Great for managing your estate while alive. But it doesn’t offer serious asset protection or estate tax benefits.

* **Irrevocable Trusts**: The Fort Knox of trusts. Once created, it’s locked. You give up control of the assets (legally speaking), which sounds scary until you realize that’s what gives it the power—creditors, lawsuits, and even the IRS will have a harder time getting in.

---

**"How do I choose between them?"**

Ask yourself:

* Do I want control during my lifetime? → **Revocable**
* Do I want maximum protection from creditors and estate taxes? → **Irrevocable**
* Do I trust myself not to mess with it after it’s set up? → Choose wisely.

Many people start with a **revocable trust**, then layer in irrevocable trusts as their wealth grows or their paranoia becomes better funded.

---

**"Which one is better?"**

"Better" depends on what you’re optimizing for:

* **Revocable**: Control, flexibility, ease.
* **Irrevocable**: Protection, privacy, power beyond the grave.

It’s like choosing between a jet ski and a submarine. One is fun and easy to turn, the other is built for surviving depth charges.

---

**"How do trust laws compare in Florida, California, and Texas?"**

* **Florida**: Very trust-friendly. Strong creditor protection, allows dynasty trusts up to 360 years. Bonus: no state income tax. Downside: hurricanes.

* **California**: High taxes, but solid trust law infrastructure. It’s common to use trusts here to avoid *their* version of probate, which is as slow and expensive as a Hollywood reboot.

* **Texas**: Also trust-friendly. No state income tax, strong asset protection—especially for homesteads. Texans love their trusts almost as much as their brisket.

---

**"Who should I hire?"**

If you’ve got real assets and want peace of mind, **hire an estate planning attorney**. Real humans. Preferably ones who know your state’s laws and won’t use Comic Sans on legal documents.

Reputable national firms with strong estate planning arms:

* [Fidelity Estate Planning](https://www.fidelity.com/life-events/estate-planning/basics)
* [Charles Schwab Trust Services](https://www.schwab.com/personal-trust-services?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* [NerdWallet’s list](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/estate-planning/estate-planning-attorney)

You can also check local bar associations for specialists in **estate law**.

---

**"Why not just use an online site?"**

You *can* set up a trust with sites like Trust & Will, LegalZoom, or Fabric. And if you’re single, have no kids, own one house and two cats named Pancake and Chaos—sure, it might work.

But if your situation involves blended families, minor children, rental properties, LLCs, or *anyone* named “Chad” who thinks he deserves your vintage guitar collection—get a pro.

DIY estate plans work right up until they don’t. And the folks left cleaning it up? They won’t be logging into LegalZoom. They’ll be lawyering up.

---

**"Any other interesting tidbits?"**

* You can name a **corporate trustee** (like a bank) if no humans in your life can be trusted not to gamble the assets away.
* A **pour-over will** works with a trust to catch anything you forgot to put in the trust. It’s like a legal Roomba.
* Some irrevocable trusts are designed to *intentionally* trigger taxes now, to save money later. Yes, this makes sense. No, I don’t want to explain GRATs in this blog. I want to sleep tonight.

**[Art Prompt](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=impressionist8):**
A golden-hued twilight scene unfolds over an aristocratic garden where elegantly dressed figures drift across pebbled paths; a woman in blue holds a porcelain parasol under whispering poplars, while a fountain glows with delicate reflections; the brushwork is soft and radiant, with powdered tones of cream, azure, and rose, capturing the serene formality and luminous grace of a Rococo daydream.

**[Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7528618146274561310):**
Glide through a golden twilight garden where powdered silhouettes sway past glowing fountains; cut between parasol twirls, slow-motion gestures, and soft laughter drifting across polished marble paths; transition to a wide shot as the sun dips and rose-tinted light kisses treetops; end with a graceful figure turning away, her silk gown catching the light as leaves begin to fall.
