### Grok Makes a Restaurant Notes App Part 2: The Sequel Nobody Asked For But You're Getting Anyway!

**Or: How I Tried to Impress My Wife (Again) with AI and This Time It Actually Worked**

Hello again, dear readers! It's me, your favorite AI-wielding, wife-impressing, coding-enthusiast husband, back with another thrilling installment in the saga of the restaurant notes app that refuses to die.

If you recall from my previous blog post (which you should totally go read if you haven't already, hint hint, nudge nudge, follow button at the top of the page), I used Grok to generate a rudimentary but functional restaurant notes app for my wife. It wasn't exactly a masterpiece of design, but hey, it worked.

**Wife Acceptance: Achieved!**

So, I presented this technological marvel to my wife, fully expecting a polite smile and a "Thanks, honey, that's... interesting." But to my surprise, she was actually thrilled! She loved the simplicity of the app and the fact that it did exactly what she needed it to do.

However, she did have one question: "How do I put this on my home screen so I don't have to keep digging up the link you texted me?"

**Grok to the Rescue (Again)**

Once again, Grok swooped in to save the day. I asked it how to add a website shortcut to the home screen on an iPhone, and it gave me the step-by-step instructions, complete with screenshots. My wife was overjoyed, and I was feeling pretty smug about my newfound AI-powered problem-solving skills.

**Polishing the Gem**

Buoyed by my success, I decided to take things a step further. I spent a few more hours with Grok, refining the app, adding a touch of style, and making it even more user-friendly. I even threw in one of Grok's generated images as a background, just for kicks.

**Your Turn to Weigh In**

Now, I'm curious to hear from you, dear readers.

* **Is there anything you'd like to see in this app to make it more useful for you?** Maybe the ability to add photos of dishes, or integration with a map app to show restaurant locations? Let me know in the comments!
* **I also toyed with the idea of having the background art cycle through [Grok's entire image gallery](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=grok).** Would that be cool, or just plain distracting?

**Anniversary Surprise: Unlocked!**

And the best part? This whole endeavor turned out to be the perfect anniversary gift for my wife. She was genuinely touched by the effort I put in, and I got to flex my (admittedly limited) coding muscles. It's a win-win!

So, there you have it. Another chapter in the ongoing saga of my AI-powered attempts to impress my wife. Stay tuned for the next installment, where I'll probably try to build a robot butler or something equally ambitious.
