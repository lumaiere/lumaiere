**Friday Night Laughs #33: Cold Turkey and Colder Punchlines**

I tried going without jokes for two weeks and started hallucinating that my dishwasher was laughing at me. I swear the soap pod smirked. Friends, I’m not saying I have a problem, but my phone autocorrected “good morning” to “why did the chicken cross the road?” So here I am. Again. Because laughter is a drug, and I’m definitely not in recovery.

I asked the IT guy, “How do you make a motherboard?”

He said, “I tell her about my job.”

---

The cashier at the bookstore asked if I wanted the receipt in the bag.

I said, “No, put it in my memoir.”

---

Parallel lines have so much in common.

It’s a shame they’ll never meet.

---

My boss told me to have a good day.

So I went home.

A group of cows were playing poker in the barn.

The stakes were high.

A fun limerick for those of you trying to wean off seriousness:

There once was a goose named Lamar,  
Who tried to do stand-up at the bar.  
He honked out some gags,  
While juggling eggs in bags—  
Now he’s banned, but he still thinks he's a star.

I tried to organize a professional hide and seek tournament…

But good players are hard to find.

---

Someone stole my Microsoft Office license key.

I will find you. You have my Word.

---

A dyslexic man walks into a bra.

And now, a little rhyme for your withdrawal relief:

**Ode to a Joke Deprived Soul**  
My humor ran dry like a lake,  
I giggled at bread by mistake.  
I chuckled at chairs,  
And flirted with stairs—  
Please send more laughs for my sake.

**Art Prompt:**  
A serene riverside garden at dusk, rendered in delicate Impressionist brushwork like Monet. Soft lavender and rose tones reflect off the rippling water. Women in flowing ivory dresses wander barefoot on mossy paths beneath willows. The atmosphere glows with scattered, golden sunlight peeking through drifting mist. The strokes are loose, atmospheric, and dreamlike, evoking a memory rather than a scene.

That’s it for episode 33—unless I relapse again next week. Humor withdrawal is real, people. Don’t let it happen to you.
