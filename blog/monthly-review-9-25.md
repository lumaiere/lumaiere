# September Review: When Numbers Dance and Hump Day Trivia

September was a month of contrasts‚Äîlike mixing bitter coffee with too much sugar, sometimes energizing, sometimes a little too much. Let‚Äôs take a lap through the numbers, wins, and misses before peeking into October‚Äôs plans. And yes, we‚Äôll sprinkle in some hump day knowledge because the calendar deserves its quirks celebrated too.

## üé® Sales & Uploads

Let‚Äôs start with the blunt fact: Redbubble sales were down **100%**. The culprit? I didn‚Äôt upload any new art in September. A self-inflicted wound, but an easy fix going forward‚Äîfeed the beast, and the beast feeds you back.

## ‚úàÔ∏è What Worked and What Didn‚Äôt

* **Successful actions**: Keeping the blog pipeline flowing, publishing in series (Artist + Testing). Structured content keeps readers coming back.
* **Unsuccessful actions**: No new art uploads tanked Redbubble and hurt social engagement.

## üê™ Hump Day Trivia

Did you know ‚Äúhump day‚Äù first appeared in print in the 1960s? The metaphor clicked because once you‚Äôre over the Wednesday ‚Äúhump,‚Äù you‚Äôre rolling downhill toward the weekend. Camels may have inspired the name, but they don‚Äôt get royalties.

[Art Prompt (Impressionism)](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=impressionist9):
A serene riverside at dusk, bathed in lavender and peach hues, where delicate ripples catch fleeting reflections of a glowing sky. Figures stroll along the bank with soft outlines, almost dissolving into the misty atmosphere. Loose, feathery brushstrokes create a dreamlike scene where light and shadow blur, evoking a fleeting, tender moment suspended in time.

[Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7556464834510851359):
Begin with a wide shot of a glowing lavender-and-peach sky mirrored in the rippling river, then slowly pan across figures walking in soft focus along the bank. Transition with dissolving mist effects, letting brushstroke-like textures drift across the frame. End with the scene fading gently into a hazy glow as if memory itself were closing its eyes.

Songs to go with it:

* Shiver ‚Äì Lucy Rose
* Lanterns Lit ‚Äì Son Lux

Follow along for October‚Äôs stories and drop your thoughts in the comments‚Äîwhat should hump day art even look like?
