# Traditional Automation Tools: Zapier, Make, and IFTTT – The Old Guard of Workflow Magic

Once upon a time—back in the internet’s “wild west” days of the early 2010s—if you wanted apps to talk to each other, you had three options: a manual copy-paste marathon, some questionable browser plugins, or a tangle of custom code you found on a forum. Then came the cavalry: **[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)**, **[Make](https://www.make.com/)** (formerly Integromat), and **[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)**.

These platforms let non-developers weave together different services like they were Lego bricks: “When I get an email, save the attachment to Dropbox,” or “If it rains tomorrow, send me a text to bring an umbrella.” They were automation’s friendly neighborhood problem-solvers—minus the spandex suit.

## What They Are

* **Zapier** focuses on business productivity—think connecting CRMs, spreadsheets, marketing tools, and databases.
* **Make** is the more visual and flexible option, perfect for building multi-step workflows with branching logic.
* **IFTTT** is the consumer-friendly tool, ideal for smart home triggers, social media posts, and hobby projects.

---

## Are They Still Relevant?

Yes—but with an asterisk. They remain powerful, especially for small businesses, solo entrepreneurs, and anyone who needs to connect dozens of apps without writing code. However, the rise of native integrations and AI-enhanced workflow builders means they’re no longer the only game in town.

---

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

* Massive integration libraries—Zapier has over 6,000+ apps.
* No coding required.
* Time-saving once set up.
* Great for rapid prototyping business processes.

**Weaknesses:**

* Can get expensive as workflows scale.
* Occasional lag in triggering actions.
* Limited customization compared to full-blown custom scripts or APIs.

---

## What Are They Used For?

* Automating repetitive tasks: Lead capture, email notifications, file organization.
* Linking SaaS tools that don’t natively talk to each other.
* Running multi-step workflows—e.g., auto-tagging files, sending updates to team chats, updating spreadsheets, etc.
* Home automation (especially IFTTT).

---

## Example in Action

Imagine you run an online store:

1. A customer buys a product.
2. Zapier detects the sale and adds the buyer to a Mailchimp list.
3. Make updates your Notion order tracker.
4. IFTTT changes your smart light to green as a celebratory flash.

---

## Alternatives

* **Native integrations** (e.g., Slack ↔ Google Drive connectors).
* **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** – open-source automation platform.
* **[Microsoft Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/)** – great for Office 365 users.
* **Custom scripts** via APIs.

---

## Popularity Trends

* IFTTT peaked around 2016–2018, but its consumer focus has narrowed.
* Zapier and Make have grown steadily, especially in the remote work boom of 2020–2022.
* Growth is flattening slightly as AI-powered automation tools emerge.

---

## History and Origins

* **Zapier**: Founded in 2011 by Wade Foster, Bryan Helmig, and Mike Knoop.
* **IFTTT**: Founded in 2010 by Linden Tibbets and Jesse Tane.
* **Make**: Launched in 2012 as Integromat in Prague, rebranded in 2022.

## AI Compatibility

All three can work with AI tools—sending prompts to language models, summarizing data, and more. They’re not AI-native, but they can be AI-enhanced.

---

## Tech Stack Compatibility

If it has an API or webhook, it probably works. These platforms integrate with cloud tools, databases, social media, marketing platforms, and even IoT devices.

---

## Interesting Tidbits

* Some people automate their dating profiles (yes, really).
* Make’s visual interface is beloved by people who think in diagrams.
* IFTTT still has fun “if this, then that” recipes for quirky uses like changing your lights when the ISS passes overhead.

---

**Bottom line:** Traditional automation tools aren’t fading away—they’re becoming the bridge between older manual workflows and the AI-assisted automations of the future.

A sweeping Abstract Expressionist canvas alive with chaotic swirls of crimson, indigo, and ochre, layered with thick, textured strokes that seem to vibrate with unrestrained emotion. Color fields collide and dissolve, creating depth and tension as splatters and drips trace the arc of the artist’s hand. Light and shadow ripple across the surface, evoking movement and raw human energy in every inch.
