### Grok Makes a Restaurant Notes App... Kinda

**Or: How I Tried to Impress My Wife with AI and Ended Up with a Website That Looks Like It Was Made in 1995**

Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts and long-suffering spouses! Today, I'm here to share a tale of AI, ambition, and a restaurant notes app that's so basic, it's practically begging for a makeover.

So, here's the deal. My wife has been on my case about creating an app to track her favorite (and not-so-favorite) dishes at restaurants. You know, so she doesn't accidentally order that one pasta dish that tasted like a salt lick disguised as a culinary masterpiece.

Now, being the ever-resourceful husband that I am (and also because I'm trying to learn how to code with Grok this month), I decided to feed Grok a prompt. I'm talking typos, grammatical errors, the whole nine yards. I figured, hey, AI is supposed to be smart, right? It can handle a little messiness.

**The Prompt That Launched a Thousand... Well, Maybe a Few Eyerolls**

Here's the prompt I gave Grok, in all its unedited glory:

> Can you generate my a web page that uses local storage (cookies or something) that you can make notes on what you like to eat in certain restaurants.  So basically there should be a + button that lets you add a new restaurant.  Then there is a field that let's you type notes for that restaurant.  It should be easy to add new restaurants, notes, and to navigate the restaurants you have already added to see the notes.  It should not need a server and work  on github pages.

**Grok's Response: A Blast from the Past**

And Grok, bless its little AI heart, actually delivered. It spat out a webpage that, while functional, looks like it time-traveled straight from the Geocities era. We're talking basic HTML, zero CSS, and a general vibe of "I'm a website, and I'm not afraid to show it."

**The Burning Questions**

Now, I know what you're thinking.

* **How many iterations or additional prompts would it take to improve this website?** Honestly, probably not that many. A few tweaks to the prompt, maybe some specific instructions about layout and styling, and Grok could probably whip up something halfway decent.
* **Did this save me time?** In a way, yes. Grok generated the basic functionality in seconds, which would have taken me at least a few hours to code from scratch. But then again, I'll probably spend a few more hours trying to make it look less like a relic from the internet's past.
* **Did it make my wife happy?** Jury's still out on that one. She appreciates the effort, but let's just say she's not exactly blown away by the aesthetics.

**The Moral of the Story**

So, what's the takeaway from all this? Well, for one, AI is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic wand. You still need to put in some effort to get the results you want. And secondly, sometimes, even the most basic solutions can be a step in the right direction.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a website to spruce up. Wish me luck!
