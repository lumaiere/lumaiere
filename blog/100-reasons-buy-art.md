Art Prompt:  
A vivid Cubist vision inspired by Juan Gris, capturing an abstracted café scene where musical instruments, glasses, and fragments of sheet music collide with angular furniture in a kaleidoscope of warm ochres, deep reds, and midnight blues. Hard-edged geometric forms overlap and interlock in rhythmic tension, creating a fragmented yet harmonious still life full of energy and cultural flavor.

Video Prompt:  
Animate a Cubist café scene where instruments and objects subtly shift positions in sync with the beat, angular shadows stretching and shrinking as the camera glides through the fractured geometry. Objects fragment and reassemble to the rhythm, evoking the lively dissonance and harmony of a jazz jam session.

Song Suggestions:  
- “Take Five” by The Dave Brubeck Quartet  
- “Blue Rondo à la Turk” by Jacques Loussier Trio
