# The Golden Rule: A World Tour of Kindness

Ah, the Golden Rule. It’s the VIP guest at every moral party: *Treat others as you’d want to be treated.* But did you know this principle isn’t just a one-religion wonder? Nope—it’s the Beyoncé of ethics: universal, timeless, and remixed in every tradition. So let’s take a scenic stroll through seven major religions, peek at their takes on this golden nugget, and sprinkle in some stories and interesting tidbits.

## **Christianity**

**The Rule:**
*"So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you."* — [Matthew 7:12 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A12&version=NIV)

**Modern Example:**
You’re in a grocery store with a loaded cart and someone behind you has two items. You let them go ahead. Later, you’re in a rush and someone returns the favor. Small kindness, big ripple.

**Tidbit:**
Early Christians called this the “Law of the Prophets,” meaning it summed up the big ethical picture in one sentence.

## **Islam**

**The Rule:**
*"None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."* — [Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 2, Hadith 13](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:13)

**Modern Example:**
You discover a great new job posting. Instead of gatekeeping it, you send the link to a friend who’s also looking. You’d want the same heads-up, right?

**Tidbit:**
“Brother” in this context means all people, not just family. Universal neighborliness.

## **Hinduism**

**The Rule:**
*"This is the sum of duty: do nothing to others which would cause you pain if done to you."* — [Mahabharata](https://sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b078.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Modern Example:**
You’re working late in an open office. Tempted to blast your favorite playlist without headphones? You don’t—because the sound of someone else’s music while you’re tired would drive you nuts.

**Tidbit:**
This principle ties to *dharma*—a Sanskrit word for “duty” or “right conduct.” Basically, the universe’s rulebook for not being a jerk.

## **Buddhism**

**The Rule:**
*"All tremble at violence; all fear death. Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill."* — [Dhammapada](https://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=130)

**Modern Example:**
Your phone battery is at 80%. Your friend’s is at 3%, and you’re both heading out. You hand them your charger, because you’d want someone to do the same before your Uber app dies.

**Tidbit:**
In Buddhism, empathy is like a mental workout—it strengthens compassion and gets you closer to enlightenment (which is just a fancy way of saying inner peace, not Jedi powers).

## **Sikhism**

**The Rule:**
*"I am a friend to all; I am everyone’s friend."* — [Sri Guru Granth Sahib](https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Search&Param=english)

**Modern Example:**
You’re grabbing coffee and notice someone struggling to carry three cups. You hold the door open instead of pretending you didn’t see them. Later, someone saves you from a latte disaster in return.

**Tidbit:**
Sikhism puts a big emphasis on *seva*—selfless service. Translation: be helpful without expecting payment or likes.

---

## **Judaism**

**The Rule:**
*"That which is hateful to you do not do to another;
"* — [Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a?lang=bi)

**Modern Example:**
You hate when people talk loudly on speakerphone in public. So, when your mom calls while you’re in line, you pop in your earbuds instead of making the whole coffee shop part of the conversation.

**Tidbit:**
Hillel, the sage who said this, delivered it standing on one foot. Today, that would go viral as a TikTok challenge.

---

## **Scientology**

**The Rule:**
*"Try to treat others as you would want them to treat you."* — [The Way to Happiness, Precept 20](https://www.thewaytohappiness.org/thewaytohappiness/precepts/try-to-treat-others-as-you-would-want-them-to-treat-you.html)

**Modern Example:**
You borrow your neighbor’s hedge trimmer. Instead of leaving it muddy in your garage, you clean it and return it promptly—because you’d want your stuff back the same way.

**Tidbit:**
While Scientology’s version is modern, it mirrors the same timeless idea: reciprocity keeps the world from feeling like a Black Friday sale.

### Why It Matters Today

Because the Golden Rule is humanity’s favorite remix. It spans scriptures, cultures, and centuries like an ethical Wi-Fi signal: invisible, universal, and way easier to follow than your router’s setup instructions.

So next time you’re tempted to cut in line at Starbucks, remember: somewhere, a spiritual leader is side-eyeing you from a 2,000-year-old text.

**[Art Prompt](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=impressionist8):**
A luminous garden scene inspired by Claude Monet’s *The Artist’s Garden at Giverny*. Picture cascading blooms in soft pinks, whites, and lilacs dancing in dappled sunlight. Loose, fluid brushstrokes capture the shimmer of morning dew, while a winding path invites the eye to wander through a dreamscape of color and texture.

**[Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7534396163571649823):**
Begin with a close-up of petals swaying gently in golden light. Slowly pan along the meandering path, letting shadows ripple like watercolor washes. Transition to overhead shots revealing a tapestry of blossoms in motion as if the entire garden breathes. Add subtle breeze animations and drifting pollen motes for a serene, hypnotic effect.

**Song Recommendations:**

* “Northern Sky” – Nick Drake
* “Holocene” – Bon Iver
