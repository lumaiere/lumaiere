**Web3 Languages, Episode 1: The Big Four — Solidity, Vyper, Rust, and Move (no buzzwords, just vibes)**

Want the 10,000-ft tour first? Here’s the **[Web3 overview you can actually own](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/web3-the-internets-makeover-you-can-actually-own-f162dd2d2f9f)**.

If you’re here mainly for systems-level nerdery, the warm-up act was **[this Rust piece](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/rust-the-programming-language-thats-safer-than-your-mom-s-facebook-privacy-settings-c4282b606fee)**.

Today we’re kicking off a five-parter on Web3 programming languages with a snackable, mildly opinionated overview of the four you’ll bump into most: **Solidity**, **Vyper**, **Rust**, and **Move**.

To keep it practical, each language gets: what it is, where it shines (and face-plants), what stacks it vibes with, who uses it, and a tiny example. I’ll also nudge you toward one real, useful product per language so you can click, build, and brag.

### **Solidity (EVM’s extrovert)**

**What is it?**
A contract-oriented language for the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** — aka the lingua franca of Ethereum and most L2s. Official docs live at **[docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)**.

**Is it still relevant?**
More than that — EVM is *everywhere*, so Solidity stays booked and busy.

**Strengths:**
Massive ecosystem, tons of tutorials, and it works across **Ethereum**, **Base**, **Optimism**, **Arbitrum**, **Polygon**, **BSC**, and more.

Tooling like **[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)** (in-browser IDE), **Hardhat**, and **Foundry** makes shipping fast and testing painless.

**Weaknesses:**
Foot-guns exist (reentrancy, unchecked math if you’re careless), the syntax has quirks, and security is always your homework.

**What is it used for?**
DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, governance, wallets, games — if it runs on an EVM chain, Solidity is almost certainly involved.

**Companies using it a lot:**
**Uniswap**, **Aave**, **OpenSea**, **Coinbase (Base)**, **Consensys**, and pretty much every L2 team that touches the EVM.

**Does it play well with AI?**
Absolutely — AI assistants can speed up contract reviews and suggest test cases. Just don’t skip audits.

**Tool stack:**
Hardhat or Foundry for testing, **OpenZeppelin** for contract templates, and **Ethers.js** or **viem** for client interaction.

**Cost:**
Gas fees. Optimize or pay in sorrow.

**Try this real product first:**
Use **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)** to sign and test transactions before you deploy anything expensive.

### **Vyper (EVM’s “keep it simple” cousin)**

**What is it?**
A Python-flavored, security-first EVM language with fewer features on purpose. Docs live at **[docs.vyperlang.org](https://docs.vyperlang.org/)**.

**Is it still relevant?**
Yep — favored by teams who want fewer sharp edges and super-readable contracts.

**Strengths:**
Simpler syntax, reduced surface area, easier audits.

**Weaknesses:**
Fewer features than Solidity, smaller ecosystem, and tooling that’s catching up.

**What is it used for?**
DeFi protocols and projects where auditability and minimalism matter more than fancy features.

**Similar to:**
Feels like “Python meets EVM with training wheels you actually keep on.”

**Works with:**
Brownie, ApeWorx, Foundry (via EVM), and Ethers/viem for client-side logic.

**Cost:**
Same gas reality as Solidity — your opcodes don’t care how poetic your syntax is.

**Try this real product first:**
Experiment directly in **[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)** — it supports Vyper right out of the box.

### **Rust (the performance engine for high-throughput chains)**

**What is it?**
A systems programming language that prioritizes safety *and* speed — the go-to for **Solana programs** and a ton of Web3 infrastructure. Learn via **[solana.com/docs/programs/rust](https://solana.com/docs/programs/rust)**.

**Is it still relevant?**
Absolutely. Rust is the backbone of Solana and other high-performance ecosystems.

**Strengths:**
Compile-time safety, fearless concurrency, performance tuning at a microscopic level.

**Weaknesses:**
Steeper learning curve, and Solana’s account model can melt your brain the first week.

**What is it used for?**
On-chain Solana programs, high-speed DeFi, and verifiable computation at the edge.

**Similar to:**
C++ that went to therapy and stuck with it.

**Works with:**
**Anchor** framework, Solana CLI, `solana-program` crate, and client SDKs.

**Cost:**
Deploy fees are low compared to many EVM chains — the real price is brain sweat.

**Try this real product first:**
Explore the **Anchor** framework through Solana’s developer docs — it makes writing programs far less intimidating.

---

### **Move (resources with actual rules)**

**What is it?**
A resource-centric smart-contract language built for safe digital assets and formal verification — used by **Aptos** and **Sui**.

Start with **[The Move Book](https://move-language.github.io/move/)** or **[Aptos Smart Contract Guide](https://aptos.dev/build/smart-contracts)**.

**Is it still relevant?**
Rising fast. Its “resources can’t be accidentally duplicated or dropped” model feels tailor-made for on-chain assets.

**Strengths:**
Strong safety model, formal verification, first-class resource types, and capability-based access.

**Weaknesses:**
Smaller ecosystem, fewer templates and examples, and a mindset shift for EVM veterans.

**What is it used for?**
Payments, identity, gaming, and any asset logic that needs inviolable rules baked in.

**Similar to:**
A stricter, Rust-inspired vibe where contracts feel like enforceable law.

**Works with:**
Aptos CLI, Sui CLI, Move Prover, and each network’s package managers.

**Cost:**
Comparable to Solana — low transaction fees, moderate learning curve.

**Try this real product first:**
Start with the **[Aptos “First Move Module” tutorial](https://aptos.dev/build/guides/first-move-module)** and deploy your first resource-based contract.

### **Quickfire Recap**

* **Solidity:** Dominates EVM chains.
* **Vyper:** Minimal, Pythonic, safer syntax.
* **Rust:** Performance beast for Solana and beyond.
* **Move:** Rule-based resource safety on Aptos and Sui.

They each reflect a different personality of Web3 — Solidity the socialite, Vyper the minimalist, Rust the craftsman, and Move the philosopher.

**[Art Prompt (Cubism):](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=cubism2)**
Fragmented planes stack into a cerebral portrait of a stringed instrument and a café tabletop, rendered in interlocking facets of warm ochre, muted slate, and smoky umber. Angular overlaps carve shadows like folded paper, while subtle charcoal lines map edges that slip between dimensions. Depth is suggested, not declared—shapes interweave with analytic precision, echoing atelier light that fractures across surfaces. Let the composition feel orchestrated yet improvised, a quiet riddle of geometry and texture that hums with restrained tension.

**[Video Prompt:](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7566591661308939551)**
Begin with a stark, overhead shot of geometric cutouts that snap into place like puzzle pieces; each cut triggers a new facet sliding in from the frame edge. Alternate tight macro shots of textured paper and charcoal lines with quick, rhythmic jump-zooms to reveal the full cubist tableau forming. Add a moment of controlled chaos—facets briefly desynchronize, then slam back on beat—before finishing with a clean pull-back to the completed composition and a crisp freeze on the interlocked planes.

* Giorgio by Moroder – Daft Punk
