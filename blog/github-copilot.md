**Completing the Guess the AI Model Game: A Tale of Copilot, Patience, and VS Code Perks**

Ever wondered if you could guess which AI model generated a particular artwork? That’s the idea behind [Guess the Model](https://lumaiere.com/games/guess-the-model/index.html), a game I built where you try to match each image with the AI model that created it. The AI prompts used in this game reflect their namesakes: Deep Dream Generator, NightCafe, Grok, Gemini, and ChatGPT. Want to see them all?

Now, let me tell you, making this game was no easy feat. I first attempted to build it with Grok, but the project quickly stalled when Grok couldn’t handle the task. So, I turned to GitHub Copilot. Though Copilot eventually got me over the finish line, the process was… grueling. It took three hours to create what should have been a quick project, requiring two manual interventions—exactly what I’d hoped to avoid.

For anyone thinking about building their own Guess the Model game with Copilot, here’s a cautionary tale: it might not save as much time as you’d expect. Copilot struggled to translate my instructions into smooth code, and while I tried reaching out to ChatGPT for help, the improvement was marginal. Perhaps my prompt wasn’t specific enough, or maybe Copilot just isn’t quite ready to take on this kind of project solo.

Despite these hiccups, there’s a silver lining. I genuinely enjoyed working with Copilot’s interface in VS Code. The *Apply in Editor* feature, which directly integrates AI-suggested code into your project, is a brilliant touch. No need to guess where to paste the code—Copilot handles that for you. This seamless IDE integration shows real promise, and I’m looking forward to seeing where they take it next.

If you’re into generative art and want to test your skills at identifying which AI model crafted each image, I invite you to try out Guess the Model and explore the Eponymous Gallery. 

**AI Art Prompt:** *Create an immersive, surreal landscape that captures the tension between human creativity and machine precision. Use dynamic shapes and a vibrant color palette that flow together yet retain distinct patterns, symbolizing the unique interpretations of each AI model. Let intricate details and balanced transitions convey the art of collaboration between human direction and machine execution.*
