# Epic Fail Jokes to Kick Off Your Friday Night Laughs

Picture this: you’re halfway through a long week, your coffee’s gone cold, and your boss just asked you to “circle back” on something you swore you’d never touch again. What’s the cure? Epic fail jokes, my friends! These are the kind of gut-busters that remind us life’s a circus, and we’re all just clowns tripping over our own oversized shoes. So, grab a snack, settle in, and let’s dive into some Friday Night Laughs that’ll have you snorting louder than a pig at a barbecue.

Why don’t epic fails ever go out of style? Because someone, somewhere, is always trying to impress their date by juggling flaming torches—and dropping them right into the picnic basket.

I told my friend he’d fail at being a mime because he talks too much. He didn’t say anything—just tripped over an invisible wall and face-planted into my dog’s water bowl.

(Stolen with pride from comedian Mitch Hedberg): I saw a guy trying to parallel park a unicycle. He didn’t make it, but he’s got a great future in interpretive dance.

My buddy tried to set a new personal record for holding his breath. He passed out in the kiddie pool and got rescued by a lifeguard who was still in floaties.

A man walks into a bar with a parrot on his shoulder. The bartender says, “Where’d you get that?” The parrot says, “At the pet store, you drunk idiot!” The man then trips over a stool and spills his beer on the jukebox.

There once was a chap from Dundee,  
Who climbed up an old apple tree,  
He slipped on a branch,  
Lost his grip in a trance,  
And landed in cider, quite free!

My neighbor bragged he could fix anything with duct tape. His car’s muffler fell off, so he taped it back on. Now it sounds like a kazoo parade every time he drives by.

(Stolen with a wink from Twitter user @DadJokeCentral): I tried to teach my goldfish to fetch. Now I’ve got a soggy tennis ball and a very confused fish doing laps around the bowl.

Here’s a little poem to keep the giggles going:  
The baker, he boasted with glee,  
“I’ll bake bread as tall as a tree!”  
But his dough overflowed,  
Through the town it did roam,  
Now he’s known for his crumbly debris.

Art Prompt:  
Create a painting of a serene riverside scene at dusk, with soft, feathery brushstrokes like Monet capturing the interplay of light and shadow. Use vibrant yet muted blues and purples for the water, blending into warm oranges and pinks in the sky. Dot the foreground with loose, impressionistic strokes of green and yellow to suggest wild grasses swaying gently, while the distant trees fade into a hazy, dreamlike silhouette. Add subtle reflections on the river’s surface with quick, dappled touches of color, evoking a peaceful, fleeting moment.
