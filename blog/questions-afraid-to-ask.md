**Everything You Ever Wanted to Know but Were Afraid to Ask**

Imagine this: you’re at a party, someone drops an unfamiliar term like “decoherence,” and you nod along like you totally get it. (Spoiler alert: you don’t.) But here’s the thing—most people don’t either. The world is full of mysteries, some grand and cosmic, others as mundane as why cereal tastes better at midnight. Today, we’re tackling the tough questions, the “I-can’t-believe-I’m-Googling-this-at-2-AM” queries. Let’s demystify the world together, no judgment attached.

### 1. **Why Do We Have Eyebrows?**
Eyebrows are the unsung heroes of facial communication. Sure, they keep sweat from dribbling into your eyes, but they also deliver sass, surprise, and the occasional side-eye better than words ever could. Their shape even helps us recognize faces—a feature so useful, scientists think it helped early humans survive. Next time you raise an eyebrow, give it the credit it deserves.

### 2. **What Happens If You Swallow Gum?**
No, it doesn’t stay in your stomach for seven years. Gum is like that one friend who crashes on your couch—it overstays its welcome but eventually leaves. Your digestive system can’t break it down, so it passes through unscathed. Consider it the Teflon of snacks: nonstick, nonabsorbent, and a little weird.

### 3. **Why Is the Sky Blue?**
Ah, the question that makes adults sweat during family dinners. The sky’s blueness is courtesy of Rayleigh scattering, which is just a fancy way of saying light waves love to party. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter more in the atmosphere than longer red ones. The result? A glorious blue dome overhead. Unless it’s sunset, then all bets are off.

### 4. **Do Fish Get Thirsty?**
Not exactly. Freshwater fish constantly absorb water through their skin, while saltwater fish drink to stay hydrated (and excrete the extra salt). They’re like the ultimate multitaskers, which is honestly more than can be said for most of us scrolling TikTok while “working.”

### 5. **Why Does My Dog Tilt Its Head?**
The adorable head tilt isn’t just for your Instagram feed. Dogs may do this to better locate sounds or understand you. Some researchers even believe it’s their way of showing empathy. So next time Fido tilts his head, know he’s not just cute—he’s a fluffy little genius.

### 6. **Can You Die of Laughter?**
Technically, yes, but you’d have to really commit. Extreme laughter can cause asphyxiation or trigger a heart attack in rare cases, but for most of us, it’s just a delightful ab workout. Laugh responsibly, folks.

### 7. **Why Is “Q” Always Followed by “U”?**
Blame the Romans. They borrowed “Q” from the Etruscans, who paired it with “U” to create a “kw” sound. English, being the magpie of languages, adopted the habit. And now we’re stuck with quirky quirks like “quintessential” and “quagmire.”

### 8. **Do Plants Sleep?**
Plants don’t sleep the way we do, but they do have circadian rhythms. Leaves can droop at night and perk up in the morning, and some flowers close their petals after sunset. Think of it as plant yoga—namaste in the sunlight.

### 9. **Why Does Your Voice Sound Weird in Recordings?**
What you hear when you speak includes vibrations traveling through your skull. A recording lacks those, so it sounds foreign. In short, you’ve been living in an acoustic lie. But hey, everyone else loves your voice—it’s just you being picky.

---

### 10. **What’s the Deal with “Déjà Vu”?**
Déjà vu might be your brain glitching, like a software bug in the matrix. Some scientists think it’s your mind misfiling new experiences as memories. Others suggest it’s linked to subtle, familiar patterns you’ve encountered before. Either way, it’s harmless—and pretty cool when it happens.
