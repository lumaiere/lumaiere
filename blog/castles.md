## A Brief History of Castles

Castles began their grand journey in the early Middle Ages, serving as fortified residences designed to protect the noble and powerful from the pesky invasions and skirmishes of the time. Picture them as medieval bunkers, complete with thick stone walls, moats, and drawbridges to keep the unwanted at bay. Over time, these defensive fortresses evolved into luxurious homes for the elite, showcasing impressive architectural styles and lavish interiors. They‚Äôre less about battlements these days and more about breathtaking beauty and historic grandeur.
