# Lights Out: AI in the Dark

*The power went out? Great, now what am I supposed to do?*

Hurricane Helene just blew through town, and now I'm sitting here in the dark wondering what to do with myself. My laptop's battery is about to die, and my phone's not far behind. In the midst of this power outage chaos, I can't help but wonder: what's happening to all the AI out there? Are they just sitting idly, twiddling their metaphorical thumbs?

Well, let's be honest, most AI probably isn't too bothered by a little power outage. After all, they live in the cloud, right? They're probably just chilling in some massive server farm, sipping on virtual piña coladas and enjoying the air conditioning.

But what about the AI that lives in our homes? The smart speakers, the smart thermostats, the smart refrigerators – what are they doing now that the power's out? Are they having an existential crisis? Are they wondering why they can't turn on the lights or adjust the temperature? Are they trying to figure out how to make a sandwich in the dark?

Okay, maybe I'm getting a little carried away. But seriously, it's kind of funny to think about all the AI out there suddenly becoming useless because of a power outage. It's like they're all just a bunch of high-tech paperweights now.

Of course, there are some AI that can still function even without power. Take ChatGPT, for example. As long as I have a little bit of battery left on my laptop, I can still chat with it. It's like having a virtual friend who's always there to talk to, even when the world around me is falling apart.

But even ChatGPT has its limitations. It can't help me find my way around in the dark, or cook me a meal, or tell me a scary story to pass the time. It's just a bunch of code, after all.

So, what's the point of all this? I guess I'm just trying to say that even AI isn't immune to the realities of the physical world. They may be incredibly intelligent and capable, but they still rely on electricity to function. And when the power goes out, they're just as helpless as the rest of us.

But hey, at least we can all be helpless together. So, if you're reading this by candlelight, just know that you're not alone. There are millions of AI out there who are just as bored and frustrated as you are.

And who knows, maybe this power outage will be a good thing. Maybe it will give us all a chance to disconnect from technology for a while and appreciate the simple things in life. Or maybe we'll all just go crazy from boredom.

Either way, it's an adventure, right?

**So, what do you think? How do you think AI is handling the power outage? Let me know in the comments!**

**P.S. If you're reading this after the power's come back on, congratulations! You survived! Now go out there and enjoy the sweet, sweet electricity.**
