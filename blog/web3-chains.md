# Chains, Brains, and Blockspace: A Friendly Tour of Ethereum L2s, Solana, Bitcoin L2s, and Cosmos Appchains

**[Web3 overview: The internet’s makeover you can actually own](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/web3-the-internets-makeover-you-can-actually-own-f162dd2d2f9f)**

If blockchains were cities, then Ethereum’s L2s are the commuter rails, Solana is a humming maglev, Bitcoin L2s are the high-security armored transit, and Cosmos is… that entire federation of bespoke towns that somehow share the same passport. Grab your digital metro card—let’s ride.

## Ethereum + L2 Rollups (Optimism / Base / Arbitrum)

**What is it?**

Ethereum is the smart-contract mothership **[ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/)**. L2 rollups like **[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)**, **[Base](https://base.org/)**, and **[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)** bundle transactions off-chain, then post proofs on Ethereum. Same security heritage, fewer fee-tears.

**Is it still relevant?**

Absolutely. It’s where the majority of web3 devs still camp out, with L2s doing the heavy lifting while Ethereum focuses on being a secure settlement layer.

**Pros / Cons; Strengths / Weaknesses**

* Pros: Inherits Ethereum security, huge toolchain ([Solidity, Ethers, Hardhat](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc2de603a08191ac93db44aaaa7fae)), deep liquidity, thriving dev community.
* Cons: UX can still feel “expert-mode,” fees spike on hot days (less so on L2), [cross-L2 fragmentation](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc338132688191b4c27536e4d6b068) is a thing.
* Strength: [Credible neutrality and composability](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc33d740ec81918036b22b1576488b).
* Weakness: Complexity—[bridges, sequencers, proofs](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc3479ed108191ba4c38a2f3bd4bf7)… lots of moving parts.

**What is it used for?**

Everything from [DeFi](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc34c0e99c8191b4cd5bac43d511ab) to [NFTs](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/can-i-actually-implement-an-nft-myself-spoiler-yup-but-bring-snacks-175e39adc7e7) to on-chain social. L2s make micro-transactions and high-frequency use cases feasible.

**Example**

Ship a micro-subscription [dApp](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc35f17ca88191bfd5ebfd3df1a688) on **[Optimism](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit)** using [OP Stack](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc3787d4188191a474a1947fae4f07), or drop an on-chain loyalty program on **[Base](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fc37d843f48191b50965c79a6ce05c)** that settles to L1 for finality.

**Alternatives**

Solana for speed, Cosmos for sovereignty, Bitcoin L2s for BTC-centric finance.

**Famous art?**

If gas spikes count as performance art, then yes. Otherwise: plenty of generative art projects, but nothing in the Louvre—yet.

**Popularity & Trend**

Developer mindshare remains massive; growth is shifting into L2 ecosystems (OP Stack “Superchain,” Arbitrum Orbit).

**Peak popularity?**

Peaks arrive around major upgrades and bull cycles; rollups are the current crescendo.

**History & Inventors**

Vitalik & friends launched Ethereum in 2015; rollup theory matured over the last few years as the scaling path of choice.

**Who uses it?**

Everyone from indie builders to major exchanges; countless brands test pilots on L2 for loyalty and micro-commerce.

**Similar to…**

Think “cloud regions” for blockspace: different zones, same base platform.

**AI-friendliness**

Good: rich SDKs, oracles, and data availability for AI agents to transact cheaply on L2.

**Tech stack & tools**

Solidity, Vyper, Hardhat/Foundry, Ethers.js/viem, Subgraphs, Sequencers/Provers. Explorers like **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)** and **[BaseScan](https://basescan.org/)** help you snoop your own app.

**Costs**

L2 tx fees are cents to fractions thereof; deploying complex contracts can still add up, but it’s night-and-day vs L1.

**Tidbit**

**Optimism’s** OP Stack powers multiple chains (including **Base**) moving toward an interoperable “Superchain.”

## Solana

**What is it?**

A high-performance L1 built for serious throughput: sub-second blocks, low fees, parallel execution. Home at **[solana.com](https://solana.com/)**.

**Still relevant?**

Oh yes. It’s the speed demon of consumer crypto: payments, meme markets, NFTs, on-chain games—all go brrr.

**Pros / Cons; Strengths / Weaknesses**

* Pros: Blazing speed, tiny fees, great for consumer UX.
* Cons: Rust/Anchor learning curve; occasional network drama historically (now much improved).
* Strength: Throughput and UX.
* Weakness: Less EVM tooling portability.

**Use cases**

Payments, micro-commerce, creator tools, mobile-friendly flows (hello, QR at checkout).

**Example**

Real-time tipping during livestreams with negligible fees; on-chain game state updates without lag.

**Alternatives**

EVM L2s (tooling portability), Cosmos (chain sovereignty).

**Famous art?**

More like famous mints—NFT seasons have been wild here.

**Popularity & Trend**

Up and to the right in users and devs; financial products circling it keep expanding.

**History & Inventors**

Founded by Anatoly Yakovenko et al.; mainnet beta launched 2020.

**Who uses it?**

Growing consumer apps, creators, payment rails, trading protocols.

**AI-friendliness**

Good for AI agents that need frequent, cheap actions (micro-tx). SDKs are maturing.

**Tech stack & tools**

Rust, Anchor framework, TypeScript SDKs, explorers like **[Solscan](https://solscan.io/)**.

**Costs**

Fractions of a cent per tx. Your latte costs more than a month of Solana gas.

**Tidbit**

Its 400ms-ish block times make UX feel web-app-like—users don’t wander off mid-transaction.

## Bitcoin L2s (Lightning, Stacks, Rootstock, Liquid)

**What is it?**

Extensions that bring speed, programmability, or confidentiality to Bitcoin while anchoring to BTC’s security.

* **Lightning Network**: instant, low-fee BTC payments via channels (**[lightning.network](https://lightning.network/)**).
* **Stacks**: smart contracts (Clarity) and Bitcoin-anchored settlement (**[stacks.co](https://www.stacks.co/)**).
* **Rootstock (RSK)**: EVM-compatible, merge-mined sidechain for Bitcoin DeFi (**[rootstock.io](https://rootstock.io/)**).
* **Liquid Network**: federated Bitcoin sidechain for fast/confidential asset settlement (**[blockstream.com/liquid/](https://blockstream.com/liquid/)**).

**Still relevant?**

Yes—Bitcoin is the liquidity king. L2s unlock utility without disturbing Layer 1 minimalism.

**Pros / Cons; Strengths / Weaknesses**

* Pros: BTC brand/security, payments at scale (Lightning), programmability (Stacks/Rootstock), confidential settlement (Liquid).
* Cons: Different trust models (channels, federations, merge-mining), varying UX.
* Strength: Built around Bitcoin’s hard-money backbone.
* Weakness: Fragmented developer experience vs EVM world.

**Use cases**

* Lightning: point-of-sale payments, remittances.
* Stacks: BTC-settled DeFi/NFTs.
* Rootstock: EVM dApps secured via merge-mining.
* Liquid: rapid exchange/OTC settlement, asset issuance.

**Example**

A café accepts sub-$5 BTC coffees on **Lightning** with near-zero fees; a treasury settles BTC-denominated bonds on **Liquid**; a DeFi protocol launches on **Rootstock** using Solidity.

**Alternatives**

Use ETH L2s for generalized smart contracts; Solana for consumer speed; Cosmos for sovereign appchains.

**Famous art?**

Plenty of BTC-themed art; Liquid’s confidential transactions are basically artistic blur for your balances.

**Popularity & Trend**

Lightning keeps expanding among payment apps; Stacks/Rootstock/Liquid are steadily carving niches.

**History & Inventors**

Lightning: Poon & Dryja paper; Stacks: Muneeb Ali & team; Rootstock: early RSK/Rootstock Labs; Liquid: Blockstream.

**Who uses it?**

Merchants (Lightning), trading desks/exchanges (Liquid), DeFi builders (Rootstock), BTC-centric app devs (Stacks).

**AI-friendliness**

Great for AI agents needing cheap instant payments (Lightning) or BTC-settled logic (Stacks/Rootstock).

**Tech stack & tools**

* Lightning: LND/Core Lightning nodes & SDKs.
* Stacks: Clarity, Hiro tools.
* Rootstock: Solidity, EVM tools; merge-mined security.
* Liquid: Elements, confidential transactions, Blockstream AMP.

**Costs**

Lightning fees are tiny; Stacks/Rootstock/Liquid txs are low vs typical L1 settlement.

**Tidbit**

Rootstock is merge-mined by major BTC pools, piggybacking Bitcoin’s hash power for security.

## Cosmos Appchains (Cosmos SDK, IBC)

**What is it?**

A toolkit for building sovereign blockchains that talk to each other through IBC—**[cosmos.network](https://cosmos.network/)** and **[cosmos.network/appchains/](https://cosmos.network/appchains/)**. Think: “roll your own chain” with native interop.

**Still relevant?**

Increasingly. Big protocols (e.g., dYdX v4) moved to their own appchains for control and performance.

**Pros / Cons; Strengths / Weaknesses**

* Pros: Full sovereignty (fees, tokens, blockspace), native cross-chain messaging (IBC), performance tuned to your use case.
* Cons: You run a chain—ops, validators, upgrades.
* Strength: Tailor-made economics and throughput.
* Weakness: You own reliability and community bootstrapping.

**Use cases**

High-volume trading (dYdX Chain), cross-chain DEX (Osmosis), specialized finance, gaming, data chains.

**Example**

A music-royalty chain that pays artists per stream in real time, bridging to other IBC chains for stablecoins and oracles.

**Alternatives**

EVM L2s (less ops), Solana (single high-perf L1), Bitcoin L2s (BTC-native).

**Famous art?**

Cosmos art lives in dashboards and mempools—Osmosis UIs get genuine design compliments.

**Popularity & Trend**

Steady builder growth; IBC connectivity keeps adding chains; “appchain” is now a normal path for mature protocols.

**History & Inventors**

Cosmos whitepaper by Jae Kwon & Ethan Buchman; Tendermint (now CometBFT) consensus + Cosmos SDK + IBC do the magic.

**Who uses it?**

**[Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/)** (interchain DEX), **[dYdX](https://www.dydx.xyz/)** (perpetuals on its own chain), Cosmos Hub (ATOM governance & shared security).

**AI-friendliness**

Excellent for AI agents that need custom fees/quotas and native inter-chain messages (e.g., pay-per-API call chains).

**Tech stack & tools**

Golang (SDK), CometBFT, relayers for IBC, explorers, chain toolkits; Cosmos Hub offers Interchain Security.

**Costs**

You control gas economics; infra and validator costs depend on how fancy you get.

**Tidbit**

IBC is basically “TCP for blockchains”—lightweight, permissionless channels between sovereign chains.

### Friday Night Laughs Mini

I tried to lift a bag of crypto “wrapped” tokens and pulled a hammy. Too many layers.

### [Art Prompt (Baroque)](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=baroque2)

A dim tavern interior cracked open by a single golden beam, faces emerging from shadow with moody lighting echoing Caravaggio; rough-hewn table angled toward the viewer, velvet-dark background swallowing detail; gestures frozen mid-whisper, fingers poised above scattered coins; saturated umbers, olive blacks, and sudden lemon highlights; fabric folds catching light like small storms; composition off-center, the bright diagonal slicing gloom to reveal surprise and human awe; paint the air itself—dust motes glittering like tiny stage lights—while edges fall away into luxurious darkness.

### [Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7564970559885315358)

Start on a snap-to-light reveal: hand slaps table, coins jump, and a hard cut ignites the golden beam across the scene; quick rhythm edits: faces pop from shadow, eyes dart, and chiaroscuro pulses in sync with percussive hits; insert micro-pushes toward the brightest highlight, then whip-back to deep black; strobe the diagonal of light to “breathe,” letting dust motes swirl in exaggerated slow-motion between fast cuts; finish with a sudden blackout and a single breath sound before a final flash of the illuminated hand.

**Songs to set the vibe:**

* Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger – Daft Punk
* Energy – Disclosure
