**December Recap and AI Predictions for 2025**

December was quite the whirlwind, wasn’t it? Let’s dive into some stats, observations, and my daring predictions for AI in 2025.

### Medium: A Mixed Bag
Medium saw a 9% increase in views, which is always a welcome holiday treat. Reads, however, dipped by 6%, proving that even the most festive month can’t distract people from their scrolling habits. Followers stayed steady—not a drop nor a surge.

The all-time favorite post, [10 Politically Incorrect Jokes That Will Make You Laugh](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/10-politically-incorrect-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-22ca82a8aa40), continued its reign as the most viewed and read. Perhaps humor is the ultimate antidote to December’s chaos. The second most viewed blog, [My Comical Quest for a Celebrity Group Hug Image with Grok](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/my-comical-quest-for-a-celebrity-group-hug-image-with-grok-8c0a90afea3d), rose in popularity—a nod to AI’s role in keeping things amusing. Meanwhile, [The Magic of Prompts: Exploring NightCafe’s Prompt Magic Feature](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/the-magic-of-prompts-exploring-nightcafes-prompt-magic-feature-1592ba53f2c1) held its ground as the second most read post. Seems like AI creativity struck a chord.

### LumAIere.com: A Holiday Bump
On LumAIere.com, page views crept up by 1%, but blog views skyrocketed by 35%, alongside a 41% surge in users. Maybe everyone’s New Year’s resolution is to learn more about AI—or maybe they’re just trying to figure out what LumAIere even means.

### X.com: Engagements Galore
X.com’s metrics were a mixed platter of success and mystery:
- Impressions shot up by 23%, proving that the strategy of slipping external links into replies was a hit.
- Likes climbed a staggering 300%.
- Engagements rose 63%.
- But new follows? Down 67%. Maybe everyone was just too busy decking the halls.

The top-performing post was this gem: [Post One](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1868482087143272574). Coming in second: [Post Two](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1868482505164337242). A healthy balance of content and strategy seems to have kept things lively.

### Promised vs. Delivered Content
December’s promised topics were ambitious:
- **Completed**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and Bootstrap.
- **Missed**: Cursor and Debugging web apps. These will carry over to January, or perhaps, they’ll star in a “Why I Still Haven’t Written About Debugging” post someday.

### Predictions for AI in 2025
1. **AI Personalization at Scale**: AI will become as personalized as your Spotify Wrapped—expect tailored recommendations that know you better than you know yourself.

2. **AI Ethics in the Spotlight**: With growing capabilities will come heated debates about boundaries. Transparency and accountability will be buzzwords of the year.

3. **Generative AI Evolution**: Models will shift from good to great—producing art, text, and even solutions that push human creativity.

4. **AI-Driven Health Insights**: Diagnostics will lean on AI like never before, from predicting illnesses to providing personalized health recommendations.

5. **Automation Surge**: Industries will embrace AI to automate tasks—some boring, some groundbreaking—reshaping job landscapes across sectors.
