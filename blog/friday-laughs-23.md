## Crime and Forgiveness: Friday Night Laughs #23

Happy Friday, my fellow chuckle enthusiasts! Another week has flown by, and here we are, ready to lighten up the evening with some criminally good humor—all without breaking the law (or at least not getting caught). Grab your favorite snack, kick back, and let’s get away with these laughs!

### Joke #1:
I asked my wife if she’d seen my newspaper. She told me that newspapers are old school and handed me her iPad. That spider never knew what hit him.

### Joke #2:
Why did the bank robber only steal Tide detergent?  
Because he wanted to make a clean getaway.

### Joke #3:
Did you hear about the kleptomaniac who got caught stealing calendars?  
He got twelve months.

### Joke #4:
What do you call an alligator in a vest?  
An investigator.

### Joke #5:
A man tried to sell me a coffin the other day. I told him, “That’s the last thing I need!”

### Bonus Limerick:
There once was a thief from Peru,  
Who only stole things that were blue.  
When asked about red,  
He laughed and he said,  
“I’m colorblind; who even knew?”

### Funny Rhyming Poem:
If you plan to commit a small crime,  
Pick one that won’t cost you much time.  
Stealing hearts? That’s okay!  
Stealing snacks? Walk away.  
But forgiveness costs nothing—sublime!

### Art Prompt:
Create a surreal masterpiece featuring a courtroom where animals are on trial, with a giraffe as the judge, a raccoon as the defense lawyer, and a parrot loudly objecting from the witness stand. Use Renaissance-style lighting and intricate details to craft an artwork worthy of a million-dollar auction.

### Wrap-Up:
