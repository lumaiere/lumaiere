**The 15 Best Jokes from the Most Famous Comedians of All Time**

Alright, alright, I give up. I've been trying to write my own jokes, but let's be honest, AI-generated humor is about as funny as a mime trapped in a glass box. So, instead of torturing you with my attempts at wit, I'm bringing in the big guns â€“ the legends of comedy whose jokes have stood the test of time and continue to tickle our funny bones.

Politically, anatomically and ecologically incorrect. I've been uplinked and downloaded, I've been inputted and outsourced. I know the upside of downsizing, I know the downside of upgrading. I'm a high-tech low-life. A cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, bicoastal multi-tasker, and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond."
