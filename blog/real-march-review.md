**Marching Forward: A Look Back at March and What's Brewing for April**

Okay, so yes—there *was* a post on April 1st claiming to be the monthly review, but if you read it and thought, *“Really? That’s it?”*—you weren’t wrong. That was our annual April Fools’ special. This? This right here is the **real** March review. Scout’s honor.

**Medium Blog Highlights**

March was no slouch. Over on Medium:

- **Views** were up 50%  
- **Reads** climbed 40%  
- **Followers**... didn’t budge. Still, quality over quantity, right?

**Top Posts**:
1. Still reigning supreme: [10 Politically Incorrect Jokes That Will Make You Laugh](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/10-politically-incorrect-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-22ca82a8aa40). Not for the faint of heart—or overly caffeinated.
2. Breaking into the #2 *most viewed* spot (after being the second most read last month): [Swagger vs. ReDoc: The Ultimate Showdown of API Documentation Titans](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/swagger-vs-redoc-the-ultimate-showdown-of-api-documentation-titans-6424e5967538). It also took the crown for most read this month. Swagger rising? ReDoc retaliating next month? We’ll see.

2. [Starlette: The Python Web Framework That’s Faster Than Your Coffee Machine](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1906551204642947152) — JavaScript might have async/await, but Python has *style*.

Also, a casual reply to [Andrew Ng's post](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1900354081119453534) made waves. Always fun when the AI crowd gets chatty.

**What We Covered in March**

March was all about *range*. A sampling:

- Backend frameworks like **Starlette**, **Flask-RESTful**, and **Falcor**
- AI tools like **DataLoader** and musings on image upscaling
- Historical oddities: **wedding anniversaries**, **apologies**, and... **avian digestion patterns**
- The Friday Night Laughs series kept the humor coming (including motorcycles, moonburn, and failed puns galore)
- Also: messaging protocols, data streaming, Kubernetes Avengers, NFTs (with snacks), and surprisingly earnest advice on embedding Redbubble portfolios.

**March AI Developments**

Let’s talk hot takes and breakthroughs:

- **AI Models Everywhere:** 2025 has officially become *The Year of AI Commoditization™*. We’re seeing smaller, more specialized models dominating niches—whether it’s fast image generation on edge devices or highly responsive chat agents trained on tiny datasets.
- **Art Gets Weirder, in a Good Way:** Tools like **Runway**, **Leonardo.Ai**, and **PixVerse** are building in real-time feedback loops and prompt tuning. Meanwhile, **Stable Cascade** (a diffusion transformer hybrid) has been getting attention for its uncanny ability to generate ultra-coherent visuals.
- **New Players:** Keep an eye on **EnvisionAI**, **Fabrica**, and **Alethea**—new kids innovating in everything from ethical dataset filtering to ultra-efficient inference pipelines.
- **Conversational Agents:** Multimodal is the new baseline. If your chatbot can’t watch a video while drawing a diagram and ordering you tacos, is it even trying?

**Art Prompt:**

**Style:** Impressionism  
**Artist:** Claude Monet  
**Inspired by:** *The Cliff Walk at Pourville*

*Prompt:*  
A luminous coastal landscape rendered in soft, dreamy strokes. Windswept grasses ripple in golden hues across rolling cliffs, overlooking a calm, cerulean sea. Wisps of cloud scatter across the pastel blue sky, catching glints of late afternoon light. Two figures in flowing dresses stroll along a narrow path, their forms partially obscured by the breeze and dappled light. The composition feels weightless, with delicate textures and a palette bathed in warmth—blush pinks, sage greens, powdery blues—evoking a moment suspended between silence and serenity.
