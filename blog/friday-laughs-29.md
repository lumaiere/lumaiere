# Friday Night Laughs: Things You Can’t Wait For  

Look, we all have stuff we look forward to—those little beacons of joy that keep us slogging through the week like caffeine-fueled zombies. But let’s be real: the anticipation is half the fun, and the other half is laughing at how ridiculous our hopes can get. So, grab your popcorn, mute your boss’s Zoom call, and let’s dive into some gut-busting jokes about the things we’re practically drooling to experience!  

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light at the end of the tunnel is just a myth anyway. (Credit: Some genius on Reddit who clearly gets it.)  

I can’t wait for the weekend—it’s the only time I get to pretend I’m a couch potato training for the Olympics.  

I look forward to payday like a kid looks forward to Christmas, except instead of toys, I get to unwrap a bill from my electric company.  

I’m so excited for my vacation that I’ve already packed my bags—too bad it’s just a carry-on full of snacks for my Netflix binge.  

I can’t wait to retire so I can finally tell my alarm clock, “You’re fired!” and mean it.  

There once was a man from Peru,  
Who longed for a day with no cue,  
He’d wait for the sun,  
To shine on his fun,  
But clouds rained on his barbecue too!  

I look forward to the gym like I look forward to a root canal—both promise results, but I’d rather just eat cake and call it cardio. (Credit: A random gym-hater on X who speaks my soul.)  

I’m counting the days until my package arrives—mostly because I need that new spatula to flip my life around.  

Here’s a little poem to keep the giggles going:  
Roses are red, weekends are near,  
I’d leap out of bed, but my cat’s commandeered,  
The couch is my throne, my snacks are my gold,  
I’m living the dream—at least, so I’m told!

Art Prompt:  
Create a painting with soft, vibrant brushstrokes like Monet, capturing a serene riverside scene at dusk. Use swirling blues and purples in the sky, blending into warm oranges near the horizon. Dot the water with shimmering reflections of light, and frame the edges with lush, feathery greens of willow trees swaying gently. Add delicate hints of pink and lavender in the distant clouds, with a subtle mist softening the entire composition.
