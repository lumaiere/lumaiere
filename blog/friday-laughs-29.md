**Things You Look Forward To: A Comedy Extravaganza**

Ah, the thrill of anticipation. That moment when you count down the days, the hours, the minutes—only for reality to sucker-punch you in the gut. We all look forward to things, sometimes too much, sometimes not enough, and sometimes we really should have known better. But hey, at least we can laugh about it. Here are some of the funniest jokes about things we just can’t wait for.

---

"I can’t wait to retire so I can do absolutely nothing. Just like I do at work, but without the judgment."

---

"They say patience is a virtue, but waiting for my food delivery is character development I did not sign up for."

---

"I was really looking forward to the weekend... until I remembered I have kids. And they don’t come with an off switch."

---

"I look forward to vacation the way my boss looks forward to making me work late right before I leave."

---

"I thought I was looking forward to my birthday. Then I realized birthdays come with aging. I take it back."

---

"I can't wait for my tax refund. It's like getting a present from my past self for overpaying the government."

---

"The only thing I look forward to more than Friday night is my bed at 9:30 PM on Friday night."

---

And now, because no comedy set is complete without an absolute literary masterpiece, here’s a limerick to sum it all up:

There once was a man full of cheer,  
Who looked forward to payday each year.  
But his cash disappeared,  
As bills reappeared,  
And now all he looks forward to is beer.

**Art Prompt:**
A vibrant riverside scene at dusk, where golden and amber light dances across the water’s surface. The sky is painted with soft pink and lavender hues, blending seamlessly into the darkening horizon. The brushstrokes are lively, thick, and impressionistic, capturing the movement of the water and the glow of the fading sun. Trees along the riverbank are rendered with rich, bold strokes, their leaves tinged with the last warm rays of light. A few silhouetted figures sit peacefully on the river’s edge, immersed in the moment, their forms blending naturally into the dreamy atmosphere.
