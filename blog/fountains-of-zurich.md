Fountains of Zurich: Where Hydration Meets History

Zurich may be famous for its banks, chocolates, and the occasional alpine view that looks like a postcard someone accidentally turned into reality, but one of its most charming secrets lies right at street level: the fountains. And not just a few—over 1,200 of them. That’s more fountains than some countries have in total, and they’re not just pretty faces either—they’re functional, free, and refreshingly Swiss in their efficiency.

A Brief History of Zurich and Switzerland
Zurich has been a settlement since Roman times (when it was called Turicum), but Switzerland’s broader history is a tapestry of neutrality, innovation, and cheese with holes. The Swiss Confederation formed in 1291, eventually growing into today’s famously independent, multilingual, and punctual nation. Zurich’s wealth and cultural influence flourished thanks to trade, banking, and a knack for turning mountains into tourist destinations.

The Story Behind the Drinking Fountains
In a city obsessed with quality—of life, water, and chocolate—the fountains are more than civic décor. Many date back centuries, originally serving as water sources before plumbing was a thing. Today, they’re maintained meticulously by the city, and most are perfectly safe for drinking. That’s right: you can stroll around and fill your bottle at a fountain sculpted like a medieval knight or a mythic beast.

Yes, You Can Drink the Water
Zurich’s tap water is famously pure, often cleaner than bottled brands. It comes from Lake Zurich, groundwater, and mountain springs, filtered to a level that would make any germ weep in defeat. Unless you see a “Kein Trinkwasser” (No Drinking Water) sign—usually for decorative fountains—you’re good to sip away.

Where the Water Comes From
Roughly 70% of Zurich’s drinking water comes straight from Lake Zurich, processed through high-tech filtration. Another 15% comes from deep groundwater reserves, and the rest from natural springs in surrounding hills. This mix gives Zurich’s water its crisp, mineral-rich taste.

Can You Swim in Them?
Tempting as it is to lounge in a marble basin on a hot day, swimming in fountains is a no-go. Zurich offers plenty of river baths (Badi) and lake swimming spots, so there’s no need to get shooed away by a city worker while you’re halfway through a cannonball.

Do They All Taste the Same?
Mostly, yes—though fountains fed by local springs can have subtle differences in mineral content. Think of it as the wine-tasting of hydration.

The Polyterrasse isn’t a fountain itself — it’s a broad terrace and lookout point in Zurich, perched in front of the main building of ETH Zurich (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology).

You can explore every single Zurich fountain on the official **[Stadt Zürich interactive map](https://www.maps.stadt-zuerich.ch/zueriplan3/stadtplan.aspx#route_visible=true&basemap=Basiskarte+(Geb%C3%A4udeschr%C3%A4gansicht)&map=&scale=1000&xkoord=2683144.4705097475&ykoord=1247154.2981450488&lang=&layer=Brunnen%3A%3A56&window=&selectedObject=broe35&selectedLayer=&toggleScreen=1&legacyUrlState=&drawings=)** by selecting the *Brunnen* layer — it’s like a treasure hunt for hydration, with each blue icon marking a real-life sip stop.

Any Famous Art?
While few are world-famous artworks in themselves, some fountains feature sculptures by notable Swiss artists. They blend functionality with artistry in a way that could make you forget they’re also your hydration station.

**Cost of Living Compared to NYC or LA**

Zurich often ranks as one of the world’s most expensive cities—sometimes topping NYC and LA. Rent, groceries, and dining out will leave your wallet lighter, but healthcare, public services, and infrastructure are top-notch. Plus, the water is free, so you’re technically saving on hydration costs.
