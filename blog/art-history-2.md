### Prehistoric and Ancient Art: The Dawn of Doodling

Welcome to Day 2 of our wild ride through art history, where we explore the origins of human creativity, starting from around **30,000 BCE** when "gallery" meant a cave wall, and "painting" involved more spitting and less brushwork. Let's dive into the epoch where art was less about "concept" and more about "can we eat this?"

#### The Cave Paintings: Humanity's First Instagram (c. **30,000 - 10,000 BCE**)

Imagine you're an ancient human. You've got no Netflix, no WiFi, just a bunch of rocks, some pigments, and an urge to tell stories. What do you do? You start the original social media: cave painting. 

**Famous Work Alert**: 
- **Lascaux Cave Paintings** (c. **15,000 BCE**) in France. Here, our ancestors didn't just leave their handprints; they left a whole gallery of animals, which, let's be honest, were probably the Instagram influencers of their time. Hashtag #BisonSelfie.

#### Ancient Civilizations: When Art Got Civilized

Fast forward a bit, humans got tired of living in caves (too drafty, not enough natural light for painting), and they started building around **3500 BCE**.

- **Egyptian Art** (c. **3100 - 30 BCE**): If you thought your eyeliner game was strong, check out the Egyptians. Their art was all about order, hierarchy, and making sure everyone knew how important the Pharaoh was. **The Pyramids**? Built around **2630 BCE**, not just tombs, but the ultimate flex in architectural art. 

- **Sumerian Statues** (c. **4000 - 2340 BCE**): Ever seen those wide-eyed Sumerian statues? Those eyes weren't wide from surprise; they were probably just trying to keep up with the latest in Mesopotamian fashion. 

- **The Venus of Willendorf** (c. **28,000 - 25,000 BCE**): A small statuette that screams fertility goddess or maybe just someone who really enjoyed her prehistoric carbs. Either way, she's got more curves than a racetrack.

#### Tools of the Trade

Back then, tools were rudimentary but effective:

- **Pigments**: Made from crushed rocks, plants, and yes, sometimes bugs, notably around **1500 BCE** when cochineal insects became a thing for reds.

- **Brushes**: If you could find something to brush with, you were golden. Hair, twigs, feathers - if it could spread paint, it was haute couture.

#### The Artistic Leap

This era was when humans went from "I can draw a stick figure" to "Behold, my narrative masterpiece of the mammoth hunt!" by around **10,000 BCE**. It was less about realism and more about capturing the essence of life, or maybe just making sure future generations would have something to puzzle over in art history classes.

#### Have Your Say

Were these ancient artists the original influencers, or were they just trying to pass the time while waiting for agriculture (c. **10,000 BCE**) to really take off? Drop your thoughts below.
