**The Whirly, Twirly History of Hurricanes in Tampa Bay**

Hey there, weather watchers and hurricane enthusiasts! Here we are, battening down the hatches once again as Hurricane Milton does its best impression of a cosmic vacuum cleaner headed our way. But let's take a breather from checking our emergency kits to dive into the swirling history of hurricanes that have decided to RSVP to Tampa Bay.

**The Last Uninvited Guest**

So, when did Tampa Bay last play host to a direct hurricane hit? That would be Hurricane Jeanne in 2004, which, while not hitting Tampa directly, was close enough to ruffle more than a few feathers. However, for a direct, no-doubt-about-it strike, you'd have to look back to 1921 with the Tarpon Springs hurricane. Yeah, it's been a while since we had a full-on hurricane house guest.

**The Hurricanes That RSVP'd 'Maybe'**

Over the last century, Tampa Bay has been the target of numerous hurricanes that apparently had commitment issues. I mean, how many times have we prepped for a hurricane party only for the guest of honor to ghost us? There's been quite a few, but notable ones include Hurricane Elena in 1985 and Hurricane Charley in 2004, both of which decided at the last minute to take their destructive dance elsewhere.

**Earliest and Latest Party Crashers**

When it comes to hurricane season, Tampa Bay has seen some early birds and some very late leavers. The earliest recorded hurricane to hit was in June, but if we're talking about those that really made an entrance, consider the June 1848 hurricane. For the latest, think about the hurricane in November 1921, proving that hurricanes don't really care for our calendar-based boundaries.

**The Record Holders**

- **Loss of Life:** The 1921 Tarpon Springs hurricane holds this grim title. Although exact numbers are murky, it was devastating enough to be remembered as one of the worst.

- **Loss of Property:** Hurricane Irma in 2017 might not have hit directly, but its broad, sweeping approach caused significant property damage with its strong winds and flooding, making it one of the costliest in recent memory.

**Some Spicy Hurricane Tidbits**

- **The Phantom Hurricane:** Ever heard of the 1944 Cubaâ€“Florida hurricane? It was so massive, its effects were felt here, but its eye was elsewhere, like a party where the DJ decides to set up in the bathroom.

- **The Lucky Charm:** Tampa Bay has this weird luck where many storms lose their oomph or change course. Maybe we're under some meteorological good luck charm?

**Prepping for Milton (and Friends)**

Now, if you're bracing for Milton or any future uninvited weather guest:

- **Preparation:** Make sure you've got your hurricane kit ready - water, non-perishable food, batteries, and, of course, a good playlist for those long, dark nights. [NOAA's got your back with checklists](https://www.noaa.gov/complete-written-plan-hurricane-preparedness).

- **Stuck with No Power?** Board games, books, or storytelling can keep spirits high. Also, remember, your car's radio can be a lifeline for updates if your phone dies.

**Stay Safe and Sound**

To everyone in Milton's path or any future storms, stay safe, stay informed, and if you're told to evacuate, don't be a hero - be a smart cookie instead.
