# Gobble Gobble: A Thanksgiving Dive into History, Traditions, and Oddities  

Ah, Thanksgiving‚Äîa day for stuffing ourselves silly, dodging that one uncle‚Äôs political rants, and engaging in a battle royale over the last piece of pie. But beyond the mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce lies a holiday with a surprisingly rich (and sometimes bizarre) history. Let‚Äôs carve into it, shall we?

## **The History of Thanksgiving: How Did It All Start?**  
Thanksgiving as we know it traces back to 1621 when the Plymouth Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Native Americans shared an autumn feast. The Pilgrims had endured a brutal winter, losing nearly half their group. When harvest time rolled around, they were justifiably relieved‚Äîand ready to party.  

But was it the *first* Thanksgiving? Not quite. Indigenous communities had long held harvest festivals, and Spanish explorers in Florida celebrated Thanksgiving as early as 1565. However, it was President Abraham Lincoln who officially made Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, in the middle of the Civil War. Nothing says unity like a holiday focused on food, right?

## **Did the Pilgrims Eat Turkey?**  
Probably not. While turkey was native to North America, the 1621 feast most likely featured venison, wildfowl (like ducks and geese), seafood, and plenty of corn-based dishes. Pumpkin? Maybe. Pumpkin spice lattes? Sadly, no.  

The turkey's rise to fame didn‚Äôt come until much later, when Sarah Josepha Hale‚Äîyes, the same woman who wrote *Mary Had a Little Lamb*‚Äîchampioned the bird as the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal in her campaign to make it a national holiday.

## **Famous Art on Thanksgiving**  
Norman Rockwell‚Äôs *Freedom from Want* (1943) is the quintessential Thanksgiving artwork. Part of his *Four Freedoms* series, it depicts a family gathered around a turkey-laden table. It‚Äôs heartwarming, wholesome, and a bit unrealistic‚Äîwho really smiles that much before dinner?  

As for art made on November 28, the Impressionist painter Claude Monet was likely dabbling in water lilies or haystacks, though no Thanksgiving scenes graced his portfolio. (Yet.)
