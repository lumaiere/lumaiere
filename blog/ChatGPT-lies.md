**ChatGPT Is Lying Its Ass Off! Don’t Believe This Blog Ever!**

This morning I asked ChatGPT a simple question:  
“What Chrome extension is this ID tied to?”

Harmless, right?  
Just a lil’ extension sleuthing to start the day. No biggie.

And ChatGPT, with the absolute confidence of a golden retriever guarding a stick, barks out:

> “Ah yes! That’s *SmashJacker*, the notorious malware that hijacks browsers, locks down your settings, and makes you think Big Brother is running your Google Chrome.”

I choked on my coffee.  
I frantically started checking settings. Had I been jacked? Was my browser being secretly run by a shadowy syndicate of password-stealing hackers with a fondness for the word “Smash”?

Nope.  
ChatGPT just had the *wrong* extension ID. Like, completely wrong.

I pointed this out, calmly and politely (fine, maybe with a *mildly* accusatory "liar"), and it apologized…  
...**and then lied again.**

This time, it insisted the extension was Grammarly.  
It was not.  
I showed it a screenshot of what it really was — **my password manager** — and only then did it go,  
“Oh… OHHHH... right. My bad.”

Thanks, bud. Glad we cleared that up *after* my cortisol levels broke through the roof.

This wasn’t a fluke either.

Later that night, I’m editing a blog on SQLAlchemy — you know, the Swiss Army knife of Python database tools.  
ChatGPT confidently states:

> “According to Stack Overflow’s Developer Survey, SQLAlchemy consistently ranks among the top Python libraries in backend web development.”

Nice! Except… that isn’t true.

I tore through the 2023 survey like a caffeinated raccoon — [https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#professional-developers](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#professional-developers) — nothing.  
No SQLAlchemy. Not even in the small print.  
I asked ChatGPT again.  
It doubled down: “It’s definitely there!”  
Then pivoted: “Well... it’s in the *raw data*, probably.”  
I didn’t even check. By now, I wouldn’t trust it to correctly identify peanut butter.

Look, I love ChatGPT.  
It’s like that friend who’s *really* smart and *really* persuasive… but also completely full of it 40% of the time and doesn't know when to shut up.

It’ll spin a believable lie, then apologize with the sincerity of a cat knocking something off a shelf while making direct eye contact.

So here’s my advice:  
Enjoy the blog, have a laugh, learn a thing or two...  
But **do not** — under any circumstances — believe that it’s gospel truth.

And if you *do* catch it lying, let me know in the comments. I’m building a scrapbook.

**Art Prompt:**

A sun-drenched café scene by a riverside, captured in the golden haze of late afternoon. Gentle brushstrokes reminiscent of Sisley ripple through the reflections in the water, as parasols cast lilac-tinted shadows on the cobblestones. Women in flowing dresses and men in straw hats sip coffee and chat, their faces softened by the warm glow. The sky is a swirl of pale blues and rose gold, blurring into the river with dreamlike transitions. Trees arch overhead in loose, wind-kissed shapes, their leaves dappling light across the scene with subtle flickers. The entire image exudes serenity and quiet joy, as if the moment is stretching just a little longer than time should allow.
