**How to Run Multiple WordPress and PHP Sites on AWS Without Losing Your Mind**

So, you want to run multiple PHP and WordPress sites on AWS. Good news! You're about to embark on a journey filled with power, flexibility, and a healthy dose of existential questioning. Let's dive into the wild world of cloud hosting with a light heart and just a touch of paranoia (because security, my friend, is serious business).

### **Step 1: Pick Your Linux Distribution Wisely**

Your Linux distro is the foundation of your server setup. On AWS, the top contenders are:

- **Amazon Linux 2023** – Optimized for AWS, security patches included, but sometimes feels a little "too" AWS-y.
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** – Popular, easy to find documentation, and works well for most setups.
- **Debian 12** – Rock solid, but less frequent updates.
- **CentOS / Rocky Linux** – Good if you miss Red Hat but don't want to pay for RHEL.

For most users, **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** wins. It's well-supported, stable, and plays nice with everything from Nginx to PHP.

### **Step 2: Setting Up Your Server**

#### **1. Provision an EC2 Instance**
- Choose an **m6i.large** instance for good performance (2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM) or **t4g.medium** if you're feeling thrifty.
- Use an **Elastic IP** so your server’s address doesn’t change when AWS reboots it in the middle of the night.
- Attach an **EBS volume** of at least 50GB (WordPress loves to hoard images).

#### **2. Install the Basics**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y nginx mysql-server php-fpm php-mysql unzip certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

---

### **Step 3: Secure It Like a Digital Fortress**

1. **Activate the firewall**
```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

2. **Harden SSH access**
- Change SSH to a non-standard port (e.g., 2222).
- Disable root login.
- Use key-based authentication.

3. **Set up automatic updates**
```bash
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
```

4. **Install Fail2Ban** to block brute-force attacks.
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban --now
```

### **Step 4: Running Multiple WordPress Sites Like a Boss**

Each site needs:
- A **separate directory** under `/var/www/` (e.g., `/var/www/site1.com`)
- A **separate Nginx config file** (stored in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`)
- **Separate PHP pools** (each site should have its own user to avoid cross-contamination)

#### **1. Create a New WordPress Site**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/site1.com
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/site1.com
```

#### **2. Configure Nginx**
Create a new file: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/site1.com`
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name site1.com www.site1.com;
    root /var/www/site1.com;
    index index.php index.html;
    
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```
Enable it:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/site1.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### **Step 5: Managing Multiple Teams Without Chaos**

Each site should have **its own Linux user** so developers can't accidentally delete another team's site.
```bash
sudo adduser site1dev
sudo chown -R site1dev:www-data /var/www/site1.com
```
Use SFTP for access and limit permissions.

### **Step 6: How Much Does This Cost?**

#### **1. Server Costs for 1M Visitors per Month**
| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| EC2 (m6i.large) | $70/month |
| RDS MySQL | $60/month |
| EBS Storage | $10/month |
| CloudFront CDN | $20/month |
| Backups | $10/month |
| **Total** | **~$170/month** |

#### **2. Developer Costs**
- **Freelancers:** $40–$100/hour
- **Managed WordPress Hosting (if you give up):** $25–$100/month per site
- **DevOps Engineer (to fix your mistakes):** $120,000/year

---

### **Step 7: AI and Scaling – Let the Machines Do It**

AI can help with:
- **Auto-scaling EC2 instances** when traffic spikes
- **AI-based security** (AWS GuardDuty)
- **Auto-scaling databases** using RDS Aurora
- **AI-powered monitoring** with Datadog or AWS CloudWatch

When traffic jumps, AI-based auto-scaling can spin up extra servers so your site doesn’t crash under Reddit or Hacker News traffic surges.

### **Final Thoughts**

Managing multiple PHP and WordPress sites on AWS isn't easy, but it’s manageable if you:
✅ Pick the right Linux distro (Ubuntu is your friend)
✅ Set up proper security (because hackers never sleep)
✅ Organize sites with separate users and PHP pools
✅ Use AI to scale like a pro

### **Art Prompt:**

A luminous Impressionist painting, evoking the soft glow of gaslights on a rain-slicked cobblestone street at night. A lone figure in a top hat and long coat hurries across a bridge, their shadow elongated by the shimmering reflections in the water below. The scene is rendered in short, choppy brush strokes, with deep blues and purples blending into golden light, creating a dreamy yet fleeting atmosphere of movement and solitude.
