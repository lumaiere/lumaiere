## A Year in AI: The Wild Ride of 2024

Ah, 2024. A year that brought both impressive breakthroughs and intriguing applications in the world of artificial intelligence. Let's dive into the most significant and verified highlights of last year.

### AI's Big Wins in 2024

Last year, AI made great strides in several areas:

1. **Universal Translators**: Google demonstrated significant progress with Gemini 2, an AI system capable of real-time, context-aware translations. Their advancements were highlighted during a demo at Google I/O 2024 ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/10/google-io-ai-updates.html)).

2. **AI-Driven Climate Solutions**: IBM’s AI-driven project "Green Horizon" contributed to optimizing renewable energy systems and refining climate models ([source](https://research.ibm.com/green-horizon/)).

3. **Medical Advancements**: AI systems developed by MIT and the Mayo Clinic enhanced early detection of diseases, including pancreatic cancer, improving diagnostic accuracy ([source](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-advances-in-ai-driven-medicine/)).

### Unexpected Uses of AI

AI found its way into surprising applications:

- **Mental Health Support**: Apps like Woebot leveraged advanced AI to help users manage anxiety and depression. Research showed these tools provided meaningful, accessible support ([source](https://www.jmir.org/2024/mental-health-ai/)).

- **Creative Recipe Generation**: Platforms like Whisk used AI to tailor recipes based on user preferences and available ingredients, showcasing its versatility in everyday life ([source](https://www.techradar.com/features/how-ai-is-changing-cooking)).

### The Models That Stole the Show

Two notable models gained traction in 2024:
