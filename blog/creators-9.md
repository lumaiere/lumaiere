**Digital Da Vincis: The Late 1900s and the Rise of Silicon Creators**

If the 1800s gave us wires and steam, the late 1900s handed us code and imagination—and a whole lot of beige plastic. This was the era when art, invention, and geekery finally stopped pretending to be separate things. Suddenly, the world's most powerful tools didn’t look like chisels or paintbrushes—they looked like keyboards, circuit boards, and increasingly shiny rectangles.

Let’s meet the visionaries who turned code into canvas and circuits into symphonies.

**Steve Jobs (1955–2011)**

* **Known For**: Co-founding Apple Inc., pioneering personal computing, and creating sleek, intuitive tech experiences.
* **Impact**: Jobs didn’t invent the computer, but he *made* people want one. From the Macintosh to the iPod to the iPhone, he combined engineering and design into pop-culture icons.
* **Fame**: Revered in his lifetime (and mythologized after), Jobs was both billionaire CEO and black-turtlenecked design messiah.
* **Collabs**: Steve Wozniak (Apple I/II), Jony Ive (Macs, iPods, iPhones), and Pixar with Ed Catmull and John Lasseter.
* **Art/Design Legacy**: His products are in MoMA. Yes, the museum. That’s how pretty they are.
* **Extra Tidbit**: He dropped acid, became a Zen Buddhist, and once said dropping out of college was his best decision. So, you know, unconventional paths can work.

**Hideo Miyazaki (b. 1941)**

* **Known For**: Studio Ghibli films like *Spirited Away*, *My Neighbor Totoro*, and *Princess Mononoke*.
* **Impact**: Proved that animation could be more than just cartoons for kids. His films blend magic, ecology, feminism, and melancholy—and still sell out theaters.
* **Fame**: Globally beloved. *Spirited Away* won the Oscar. Totoro is basically Japan’s Mickey Mouse.
* **Collabs**: Isao Takahata and Joe Hisaishi (that music? chef’s kiss).
* **Subject of Art**: There are murals, parodies, essays, theme parks. He *is* a walking art movement.
* **Interesting Tidbit**: He famously hates computers and prefers hand-drawing frames. Yes, even in the Digital Age.

**Tim Berners-Lee (b. 1955)**

* **Known For**: Inventing the World Wide Web. Like, *literally* the thing you’re using right now.
* **Impact**: Built the first browser and server. Then—get this—he *gave it away for free*. That’s like Da Vinci handing out Mona Lisas at a garage sale.
* **Awards**: Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Also received the Turing Award. And your eternal gratitude.
* **Fame**: Famous in nerd circles, criminally underrated everywhere else.
* **Collabs**: Worked at CERN. Also helped form the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
* **Extra Tidbit**: He’s still advocating for an open, user-owned internet. Basically the Gandalf of digital rights.

**Ada Lovelace? Alan Turing? Nope—This Was the Era of the Hacker-Artist**

This wasn’t just the age of companies—it was the age of the *garage*. Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds—they didn’t paint frescoes; they wrote shell scripts and rewired reality. The aesthetic? ASCII art. The gallery? Your screen.

**Why This Century Mattered**

* **First Graphic UIs**: Computers became visual.
* **Digital Audio & MIDI**: Music creation democratized.
* **CGI & Pixar**: Hollywood was never the same.
* **The Internet**: Entirely new art forms and memes (the chaotic street graffiti of the 21st century).

**Art Prompt:**
Inspired by Impressionism (artist selected: Claude Monet; piece: *Woman with a Parasol*)
"A luminous outdoor scene painted in delicate, swirling brushwork. A lone figure in flowing robes walks along a sun-drenched hillside under a soft azure sky, holding an umbrella that casts dappled shadows across the wildflowers. The palette is alive with pastels—gentle greens, airy blues, and creamy whites—with the breeze hinted at by the tilt of grasses and the angle of her stride. The overall feeling is both fleeting and eternal, a moment suspended in summer air."
