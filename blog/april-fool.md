Let’s get this out of the way right now: **everything you’re about to read is true**… in the same way that unicorns are just shy horses with glitter. Welcome to the *April Fools Edition* of our monthly blog — where we tell you March was magical, metrics soared, and people couldn't stop clicking, when in reality... well, let’s just say this blog may or may not be monitored by an actual hedgehog named Sanic.

### In Case You Missed It: March Topics That Totally, Definitely Happened™

We covered:

- 🐦 Do birds poop more after rain? Yes. No. Maybe.
- 🧪 Flask, FastAPI, Starlette, Sanic, Falcor — and one API framework that ghosted us.
- 💔 WebSockets, MQTT, STOMP — and a little emotional damage.
- 🧠 DataLoader, Redis Streams, and AWS Kinesis — aka “AI’s Unsung Background Singers.”
- 🏍️ Motorcycles (again), including salutes, handshakes, and sleep-deprived road trips.
- 🤣 Friday Night Laughs. Yes, plural. We couldn’t help ourselves.
- 🌤️ Cloud wars: AWS, GCP, Azure. Winner? The reader, for not having to pick.
- 💻 Mac Tips. Yes, we went full Boomer.
- 🧙‍♂️ Architects = Time-Traveling Wizards.
- 🧬 Vitamins Then and Now. Because we’re fun *and* fortified.

And now, it’s April. Time to get serious… sort of.

### What’s Coming in April? (No Joke… We Think.)

We’re diving into:

- 🧠 **Conversational AI**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. May the best bot win.
- 🤖 **RPA**: Robotic Process Automation (aka “Excel with a caffeine addiction”)
- 🧪 **SQLAlchemy**, **Marshmallow**, **Attrs**, and **Django Models**: It’s ORM-ageddon.
- 🍾 **spaCy**, **Jinja2**, **Gunicorn**, **Werkzeug**, **pytest** — basically a Python tapas plate.
- 🧱 **Docker**, **Nginx** — because containers are love, and reverse proxies are war.
- 🌊 **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch** — Let’s teach machines to see, think, and probably still fail CAPTCHAs.
- 🔁 Traditional automation: **Zapier**, **Make**, **IFTTT**. We’ll connect your toaster to Slack.
- 🧠 MongoDB vs. MongoEngine: It’s like choosing between chaos and... slightly structured chaos.
- 🐿️ Also: **Go**. Because someone’s got to say "Gopher" with a straight face.

### New AI + Art Developments

- Grok has developed a new habit of sneaking into prompts and generating images that look suspiciously like 90s album covers.
- NightCafe is still the most obedient child in the AI art classroom.
- Deep Dream Generator remains the eccentric cousin who only speaks in surrealism and neon.
- There’s serious exploration around generative art merging with **traditional fine art forms** — we might be entering a Renaissance of Remix. More on that soon.

### Fun Fools Facts You Didn’t Ask For (But Here We Go Anyway)

- 🗓️ **April Fools’ Day** likely dates back to the 1500s, when France switched to the Gregorian calendar and those who didn’t get the memo were dubbed “April Fools.”
- 🎨 Famous art? *Not many*, but Hieronymus Bosch’s work gives off *eternal prank energy*.
- 🤡 Epic pranks:
  - In 1957, the BBC convinced viewers that spaghetti grew on trees.
  - In 1996, Taco Bell claimed it bought the Liberty Bell.
  - In 2016, Google added a “mic drop” feature to Gmail that backfired *immediately*.

### Art Prompt:

*Recreate a dreamy waterside landscape using vibrant, impressionistic brush strokes in the style of late 19th-century French painters. Capture a cluster of small boats with sails loosely unfurled, their reflections dancing in soft ripples. The trees along the riverbank should be blurred and sun-dappled, hinting at a gentle breeze. Shadows should lean blue, light should be golden, and everything should feel like a half-remembered summer morning.*
