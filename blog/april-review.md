**April Showers Bring... Space Gossip, ORM Dramas, and Bananas?**

April was a wild ride. We laughed, we coded, we may have cried over AI hallucinations, and‚Äîif Medium stats are to be believed‚Äîwe definitely got our read on.

**üìä The Stats We‚Äôre Quietly Bragging About**

- **Medium** was doing hot girl math:
  - Views: **up 62%**
  - Reads: **up 59%**
  - Followers: **up 14%**

  Leading the popularity contest was ‚Äú[Swagger vs. ReDoc: The Ultimate Showdown of API Documentation Titans](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/swagger-vs-redoc-the-ultimate-showdown-of-api-documentation-titans-6424e5967538)‚Äù‚Äîwhich finally took the crown from ‚Äú[10 Politically Incorrect Jokes That Will Make You Laugh](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/10-politically-incorrect-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-22ca82a8aa40)‚Äù after its six-month reign. The sass of Swagger prevailed.

- **Blog.lumaiere.com** was... mellow:
  - Page views: **down 1%**
  - Blog views: **down 2%**
  - Users: **down 10%**

  But not all was lost! ‚Äú[The Art of Saying Sorry: History‚Äôs Best Apologies and What We Can Learn From Them](https://blog.lumaiere.com/the-art-of-saying-sorry-historys-best-apologies-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them/)‚Äù reclaimed the top spot after a brief demotion. Meanwhile, ‚Äú[The Meaning of Life: A Cosmic Joke or a Deep Truth?](https://blog.lumaiere.com/the-meaning-of-life-a-cosmic-joke-or-a-deep-truth/)‚Äù made a surprise leaderboard debut.

A close second was the not-at-all-real ‚Äú[ChatGPT Is Lying Its Ass Off! Don‚Äôt Believe This Blog Ever!](https://x.com/DaveLumAI/status/1910512820120092674).‚Äù

  - Reach: **down 52%**
  - Followers: **up 4%**

**üß† What We Covered in April**

April‚Äôs content calendar had range. Like, Mariah-Carey-octave-range:

- ORM drama in *‚ÄúDjango vs Peewee vs Tortoise‚Äù*
- Deep dives into spacy NLP
- Bananas. Pickleball. More bananas.
- API docs, version conflicts, and how to *explain that post*
- Themed absurdity in Friday Night Laughs #33 and Rust's surprising privacy advantages
- GoDaddy PHP gymnastics
- Cold turkey quitting AI hallucinations
- Selling with charm (and possibly some slapping)

Yes, those are all real. Check the receipts.

**üîÆ What‚Äôs Coming in May?**

Buckle up. May is going full-stack:

- **Software architecture** deep dives
- Backend royalty: Django REST, ASGI/WSGI, Gunicorn, Nginx
- **Automation** showdown: Zapier, Make, IFTTT vs. RPA tools
- **ML libraries** like TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, and *why your GPU hates you*
- **Messaging Madness** with Kafka‚Äôs cousins: Zookeeper, BookKeeper, HiveMQ, Mosquitto
- **Database tech** including MongoDB vs. MongoEngine, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and Cython
- Plus web3 stuff, strange acronyms (OASIS? Qpid?), and... *MirrorMaker?* That sounds like a D&D artifact.

Let me know what you're most excited for‚Äîor what you're afraid I‚Äôll write about anyway.

**üì£ Sound Off, Space Nerds and ORM Queens**

Drop a comment if:
- You‚Äôre still confused about the Django ORM drama
- You think Swagger is overrated
- You‚Äôve ever hallucinated a banana while debugging

And don‚Äôt forget to **follow** for more AI antics, tech rants, and semi-intentional jokes.

**Art Prompt:**  
A tranquil riverside picnic in dappled sunlight, rendered with soft, pastel tones and gentle brushstrokes reminiscent of Berthe Morisot. Light dances on the rippling water as figures in airy 19th-century dresses lounge under blossoming trees. The mood is serene and wistful, with blurred outlines lending a dreamlike softness to the composition.
