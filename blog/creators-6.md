**The Enlightened Century: 1700s Minds That Sparked Revolutions**

Take a powdered wig. Add a snuffbox, a harpsichord, and a brain filled with dangerously new ideas. Welcome to the 1700s, where “Enlightenment” wasn’t just a vibe—it was a full-blown intellectual uprising. Think less astrology, more astronomy. Less divine right, more human rights. The 18th century gave us some of the most impactful creators of all time, and they did it with flair, feathers, and the occasional guillotine.

Let’s meet a few of these sparkly cerebrums:

---

**Voltaire**

* *Known for?* Sassy satire, radical wit, and writing books that annoyed kings and priests alike.
* *Impact on society?* He championed freedom of speech, religious tolerance, and rational thought—basically the holy trinity of modern democracy.
* *Awards?* No trophies, but he was exiled multiple times, which in the 1700s was the literary equivalent of going viral.
* *Financially successful?* Absolutely. Voltaire was not only rich in ideas, but also just… rich. He gamed the lottery system with mathematical precision.
* *Famous in his time?* Incredibly. If Enlightenment thinkers were rock stars, Voltaire was Mick Jagger.
* *Collaborations?* Wrote letters with Catherine the Great and sparred intellectually with Rousseau. Think philosophical pen pals with major drama.
* *Known for art?* His weapon was the pen, not the paintbrush, but his works inspired countless paintings, plays, and revolutions.
* *Other inventions?* A robust fake identity system. The man had more pseudonyms than a hacker in a heist movie.
* *Subject of art?* Yes—often portrayed in paintings as the personification of Reason (though with a sneaky side-eye).
* *Interesting tidbit?* Voltaire famously quipped on his deathbed when asked to renounce Satan: “This is no time to make new enemies.”

**Mozart**

* *Known for?* Being a musical prodigy and composing over 600 works before the age of 36, because apparently sleep was optional in the 1700s.
* *Impact on society?* He revolutionized classical music, giving us operas that had both complexity and hummability. (Looking at you, *The Magic Flute*.)
* *Awards?* None official—just the lifelong envy of every composer who came after.
* *Financially successful?* Briefly. Then not. Then a little. Then very not. Let’s call it "fiscally chaotic."
* *Famous during life?* Very. Mozart was the 18th-century equivalent of trending on every platform.
* *Collaborations?* Worked with librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte to create operas so catchy even your grandma has hummed them.
* *Known for art?* If music counts as art—and it does—then yes. Gloriously so.
* *Other inventions?* Reinvented the symphony, the piano concerto, and public concert structure.
* *Subject of art?* A ton. Paintings, busts, movies (hi, *Amadeus*), and even a few regrettable bobbleheads.
* *Interesting tidbit?* Mozart wrote a song called “Leck mich im Arsch,” which translates exactly how you think. He was a genius *and* a goofball.

**Benjamin Franklin**

* *Known for?* Inventing bifocals, catching lightning in a bottle (literally), and founding America between naps.
* *Impact on society?* Helped birth a nation, develop libraries, and make postal service sexy.
* *Awards?* Honored worldwide. Even France liked him more than their own citizens.
* *Financially successful?* Yes. Especially from his printing business. Side hustle: founding father.
* *Famous during life?* Hugely. In France, they printed his face on plates. It was a whole thing.
* *Collaborations?* With Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and every salon in Paris.
* *Known for art?* Wrote snappy essays and proverbs, and his witty writing bordered on performance art.
* *Other inventions?* Lightning rod, Franklin stove, harmonica (not the blues kind).
* *Subject of art?* So many portraits. Franklin had a very paintable face.
* *Interesting tidbit?* Suggested the turkey over the bald eagle for America’s national bird. Can you imagine?

**Art Prompt:**
In the dreamy, light-drenched style of Claude Monet, imagine a secluded Parisian garden in full bloom, framed by ivy-covered archways. The scene is bathed in morning mist and soft pinks, blues, and buttery yellows. A lone figure with a powdered wig and violin case strolls down a gravel path toward an ornate wrought-iron gate. The brushstrokes shimmer with vibrancy, evoking a sense of poetic calm and intellect in bloom.
