**Friday the 13th: When Horror Villains Hit Stand-Up**

Happy Friday the 13th, everyone! It's a spooky Friday night, and what better way to celebrate than to see what our favorite horror villains would bring to the comedy stage? Imagine a world where Jason, Freddy, and Michael take a break from all that relentless slashing and instead try their hands at stand-up comedy. Here’s to hoping they leave their weapons backstage…or at least keep the jokes killer and not the crowd!

### Jason Voorhees on Dating:
"I’m really bad at dating. Every time I try to swipe right, it’s with a machete! Not a great way to win hearts… or, well, keep them intact."

---

### Freddy Krueger on Sleep Patterns:
“People these days are obsessed with sleep trackers. I don’t need one—I just invade your nightmares and check in. Rest assured, I know exactly how many REM cycles you missed!”

---

### Michael Myers on Halloween Decorations:
"My neighbor put up ‘Scary Michael Myers’ decorations this year. I went over to thank him, and he just fainted. People are so *extra* during Halloween!"

---

### Pennywise on Childcare:
“Kids these days don’t want to play in the sewer with me. Apparently, they’re ‘too busy’ playing Minecraft. Honestly, who needs a creepy clown when they have skeletons in block form?”

---

### Ghostface on Technology:
"Everyone freaks out when they get a call from an unknown number. But back in the '90s? Those were my golden years! Caller ID ruined my career, but thanks to spam calls, I’m making a comeback."

---

### Chucky on Toy Story:
"Toy Story was cute, but let’s be honest… those toys never had to deal with factory recalls. It’s not easy being a doll when everyone wants a refund."

---

### Hannibal Lecter on Fine Dining:
"People think I'm a picky eater, but really, I’m all about trying new things. I’m like, ‘Where’s the liver section?’ And no one finds that funny!"

---

### Jigsaw on Escape Rooms:
“People pay money to get trapped in escape rooms now. Amateur hour, really. Back in my day, if you didn’t find the way out… you just didn’t get out. Period.”

---

### Norman Bates on Family Dynamics:
"My mom and I had a close relationship. Some say it’s unhealthy, but they just don’t get it. She’s still with me... even when she’s not."

### AI Art Prompt

For the AI art aficionados: Imagine a dark comedy club with horror movie icons like Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, and Pennywise on stage with mics, delivering their best stand-up routines. The audience is a mix of laughing zombies, clapping vampires, and a few fainting humans. The backdrop has "Friday Night Laughs" glowing in neon against a blood-red curtain. Make it atmospheric, eerie, and funny.
