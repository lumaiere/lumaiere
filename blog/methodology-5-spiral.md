Spiral Model – Round and Round We Go

If software development methodologies were rides at a theme park, the Spiral Model would be that slow, turning carousel that looks deceptively gentle—until you realize you're on it for eternity, going in circles with increasing speed and existential dread.

What is it?
The Spiral Model is a risk-driven software development process that combines the rigid structure of Waterfall with the iterative nature of prototyping. Imagine Waterfall went to therapy and learned to communicate its feelings—voilà, Spiral Model.

It’s laid out as—you guessed it—a spiral. Each loop around represents a development phase: planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. Rinse and repeat, only each loop is slightly larger and deeper in scope than the last. Kind of like your relationship with your favorite bug.

Is it still relevant?
Not as trendy as Agile or Scrum, but still lurking in the background like that one guy who insists Clippy was a misunderstood genius. It’s especially favored in high-risk, high-cost projects like defense systems or space exploration, where failure is not an option (or at least not an affordable one).

Pros and Cons
Pros:
- Great at managing risk. If anxiety were a methodology, this would be it.
- Built-in flexibility with structured checkpoints.
- Encourages user feedback early and often.

Cons:
- Complex to manage—requires skilled project managers.
- Not suitable for small, quick projects.
- Budget-wise, it’s the software equivalent of ordering truffle fries every time.

Strengths and Weaknesses
Its strength lies in risk mitigation and adaptability. But it gets weighed down by complexity. Like using a tactical nuke to toast your bread—impressive, but maybe overkill.

What is it used for?
Critical systems where bugs could cost lives or serious money. Think aerospace, defense, banking systems. Not ideal for your nephew’s new To-Do list app.

Example?
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has employed Spiral-like models in large-scale software development projects. When you’re programming a Mars rover, you want to make damn sure every line of code has been analyzed more thoroughly than a celebrity’s Twitter feed.

Alternatives?
Agile, Scrum, Kanban, RAD, XP—all with their own quirks. Spiral is the granddaddy who still writes checks but carries a smartphone.

History and Origin
Developed by Barry Boehm in 1986, the model emerged from a desire to blend risk assessment with incremental development. Barry looked at Waterfall and said, “Nice start, but let’s add fear.”

Who uses it?
Organizations where you don’t just YOLO your product launch. Think military contracts, large enterprises, and folks who use “deliverables” in casual conversation.

Popularity Trajectory
Peaked in the '90s and early 2000s. It's not gone—it’s just very niche now. Kind of like vinyl records or those who can write legibly in cursive.

Similar To?
It’s like if Waterfall and prototyping had a baby who grew up to be an overachiever with anxiety.

Does it work with AI?
Not naturally. Spiral is all about deep upfront risk analysis, and AI thrives on rapid iteration and data-driven improvisation. They’re like two coworkers who nod politely but never eat lunch together.

Tech Stack?
Language-agnostic. Spiral doesn’t care if you’re using C++, Python, or interpretive dance—as long as you manage risk like a paranoid actuary.

Tools?
Project management tools like Rational Unified Process (RUP), IBM Rational, and custom PM dashboards help. Plus coffee. Lots of coffee.

Fun Tidbit?
It was featured as a cautionary example in more than one "Agile is better" presentation at tech conferences. Poor Spiral—forever the PowerPoint punching bag.

And yes, if you’re wondering, this blog was written while I sat waiting for my motorcycle to be resurrected at Corsa Moto Works. I found them thanks to this guide on finding good mechanics: https://blog.lumaiere.com/how-to-find-a-great-motorcycle-mechanic/

Art Prompt:
A fragmented composition of angular shapes and intersecting planes, awash in dusty earth tones and muted blues, the image evokes a deconstructed cityscape under shifting light. Figures appear abstracted, as if frozen in time mid-gesture. The perspective is fractured and cubist, the scene vibrant with subtle kinetic energy.

[Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7517830469698833695):
Start with geometric shards assembling rapidly into a surreal skyline, then dissolve into scenes of fragmented motion—people walking, clocks ticking, hands typing—all looped in endless rhythms. Use sharp transitions and rotating overlays to mirror the cubist aesthetic, timed to ambient pulses and rising tones.

Tried explaining recursion to my dog by hiding his toy inside another toy inside another toy.

Now he just stares into the void and growls at nesting dolls.
