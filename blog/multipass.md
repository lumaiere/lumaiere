**Multipass: The Lightweight VM That Makes My Mac Purr Like a DevOps Kitty**

Let’s get one thing straight: I’m not here to trash heavyweights like VirtualBox or VMware. They’re great, they’re powerful, and they’ve saved lives—probably. But sometimes, you just want to spin up a clean little Ubuntu box without summoning the ghost of sysadmins past. That’s where Multipass comes in. It’s like the IKEA flat-pack of VMs: lightweight, efficient, and Swedishly satisfying (except it’s made by Canonical, so maybe… Britishly satisfying?).

---

### What Is It?

[Multipass](https://multipass.run/) is a command-line tool by Canonical (yes, the Ubuntu folks) that lets you launch and manage Ubuntu virtual machines with near-zero friction. It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux, but I use it on my Mac because I like my VMs like I like my coffee—hot, isolated, and inside a tiny virtual sandbox.

You type `multipass launch`, and poof—you get an Ubuntu instance faster than you can say “apt-get install existential-purpose.”

---

### Is It Still Relevant?

Oh yes. In the age of containers, Kubernetes, and AI-generated pizza recipes, Multipass is still relevant because not everything needs to be containerized. Sometimes you want a full-fat Linux VM without needing Docker, Kubernetes, or a PhD in YAML. Multipass gives you just enough of Ubuntu to run real workloads without needing a whole datacenter to support it.

---

### What Is It Used For?

* **Dev/test environments:** Quickly spin up clean machines for testing.
* **Local sandboxing:** Isolate risky operations like “what happens if I sudo this…”
* **Running scripts across multiple Ubuntu versions.**
* **AI model testing in a contained environment.**
* **Feeling superior to people still using shared hosting.**

---

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* 🪶 *Lightweight* – Minimal system overhead.
* 🏃‍♂️ *Fast launch times* – Literally seconds.
* ⌨️ *CLI-based* – Great for developers and automation.
* 💻 *Native VM backends* – Uses HyperKit on macOS, Hyper-V on Windows, etc.
* 📦 *Built-in support for cloud-init* – Perfect for provisioning.

**Cons:**

* 🧱 *Only Ubuntu* – Sorry Fedora fans, this one’s for the Debian kids.
* 📉 *No fancy GUI* – CLI-only, unless you enjoy typing `multipass shell`.
* 🔌 *Limited network options* – Basic networking unless you do some funky bridge magic.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

Its biggest strength is simplicity. You don’t need to think about memory allocation or network interfaces unless you *want* to. Its weakness? Also simplicity. If you need advanced VM configuration or other Linux distros, you might feel boxed in.

---

### Example Time! (a.k.a. "Show Me the Shell")

```bash
# Launch an Ubuntu VM
multipass launch --name testbox

# Shell into it
multipass shell testbox

# Run your stuff
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
```

Want to mount a folder from your Mac?

```bash
multipass mount /Users/me/dev testbox:/home/ubuntu/dev
```

Your code’s now inside the VM like it’s sneaking into a speakeasy through the back door.

---

### Alternatives?

* **Docker:** Good if you like your operating systems like you like your IKEA furniture: modular, disposable, and oddly named.
* **VirtualBox:** Still solid but heavier.
* **Parallels Desktop / VMware Fusion:** Gorgeous, but expensive and overkill for dev testing.
* **Vagrant:** Great if you like writing config files instead of doing actual work.

Multipass lives in that sweet Goldilocks zone: not too heavy, not too shallow. Just right.

### History and Popularity

Canonical released Multipass in 2018. It wasn’t a thunderous entrance—it kind of sneakily showed up like a polite British butler. Since then, it’s become a secret weapon for developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone who hates setting up Ubuntu VMs the old-fashioned way.

Popularity? It’s not trending like TikTok dances, but it’s quietly respected. Kind of like a cardigan-wearing wizard who keeps showing up at exactly the right time.

---

### Who Uses It?

* **Solo developers** tired of Docker rabbit holes.
* **QA teams** testing across Ubuntu versions.
* **Students** who don’t want to bork their OS.
* **AI tinkerers** testing models in isolated environments.

Canonical itself uses it, and chances are anyone working with Ubuntu regularly has at least flirted with it.

---

### Does It Work Well with AI?

Yes, for lightweight AI dev, especially models running locally or as part of testing workflows. You can spin up a VM, install your dependencies, and keep all your model weights, data, and questionable experiments sandboxed from your host system.

---

### Tech Stack Compatibility

Multipass plays well with:

* Python, Node, Go, Rust
* Bash scripts
* VS Code via Remote SSH
* AI tools like Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, TensorFlow (assuming you install them)

Basically, if it runs on Ubuntu, it runs on Multipass. Except hopes and dreams. Those need WSL2.

---

### Tools That Work Great With It

* [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) – Provision your VM with a script at launch.
* [VS Code Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) – Connect directly to your Multipass instances.
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) – For provisioning and config management.
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) – Because your Multipass deserves split panes.

### Fun Tidbit

Multipass got its name from *The Fifth Element*—yes, that movie where a multipass is the ultimate key to everything. Just like in the movie, your `multipass` gets you into all kinds of cool places. No orange-haired savior required.

---

### So… Is It the Subject of Any Famous Art?

Tragically, no. No one’s painted “Girl With the Multipass.” Yet.

---

### The Verdict?

If you need a VM for Ubuntu and don’t want to overthink it, Multipass is *chef’s kiss*. Lightweight, powerful, and shockingly easy to use.

**Art Prompt:**
Gentle brushwork captures a sun-dappled lakeside scene, where elegant figures stroll beneath flowering trees. The palette bursts with soft peach, coral, and dappled emerald greens, reflecting on rippling water in shimmering, broken color. The figures dissolve slightly into their surroundings through loose, swirling strokes, creating a dreamy blur between form and nature. The composition emphasizes balance and leisure, with the afternoon light dancing across parasol-free pastimes and the subtle joy of summer idleness. Impressionist lighting and tranquil ambiance dominate the mood.
