## Observations

* **Most popular blog posts**: Swagger vs. ReDoc, Politically Incorrect Jokes, Libpostal Deep Dive, and 15 Best Jokes. Humor and practical tech continue to dominate.
* **Least popular**: Travel posts on Zurich fountains and Konstanz lakeside had fewer clicks compared to AI/testing content.
* **Patterns**: Humor + technical deep dives = engagement. Travel = lighter engagement, though still important for brand mix.
* **Successful actions**: Consistent posting, X engagement, and TikTok video experiments.
* **Unsuccessful actions**: Facebook ads or content—numbers fell across the board there. Shares on TikTok also need adjusting.
* **Interesting tidbit**: Replies on X can outperform original posts. That “please explain” reply? It explained itself—loud and clear.

## Looking Ahead to September

The **Artist Series** and **Testing Frameworks: Choose Your Fighter** march on. Expect dives into:

* Zookeeper
* Apache BookKeeper
* MirrorMaker
* Tiered Storage
* Web3
* Forge (NFT focus)

And more travel (with a limerick to set the mood):

There once was a traveler spry,
Who chased down the clouds in the sky.
With a map and a grin,
They dove right on in—
And left with more stories than pie.

[Art Prompt](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=impressionist8):
An airy countryside tableau bathed in luminous pastel tones, rolling hills dotted with villagers in timeless attire, painted with quick, dappled brushstrokes that capture fleeting light and shadow. The atmosphere feels alive with motion, as if laughter drifts in the air. Warm peach and golden yellows dominate, balanced by soft lavender skies and hints of cool blue in shadowed corners. Figures move gracefully, blending into the landscape rather than standing apart, evoking harmony between humanity and nature.

[Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7546431348098026782):
Begin with sweeping pans across sunlit hills awash in golden glow, transitioning into dynamic cuts of villagers laughing, dancing, and moving in rhythm with fluttering light. Camera shifts softly blur between close-ups of smiling faces and wide angles of the glowing countryside, syncing each movement with the play of color—peach, lavender, and cool blues flickering like brushstrokes across the screen. The mood should feel alive, fleeting, and joyful, as though the scene itself might vanish with the next breeze.

Songs to go with it:

* Myth – Beach House
* Sun Hands – Local Natives
