## July Review: The Heat, The Hits, and a Hint of August

July came in swinging like a caffeinated octopus—arms everywhere, stats flailing, and the occasional ink cloud of confusion. Let’s unpack it.

* **Facebook:** Views down 23%, reach squeaked up 4%, total followers up 10%, but new followers took a 33% nosedive. Interactions? Down 89%. Clicks plummeted 40%, and visits nosedived 63%.

  Both also took the top two spots for likes.

### **What Worked & What Didn’t**

**Winners:**

* Deep, nerdy API showdowns and snarky humor posts crushed it on Medium.
* TikTok finally acted like TikTok—big views, big shares, more likes than your grandma’s cat videos.

**Losers:**

* Facebook interactions fell off a cliff. If you see them, send a search party.
* Blog traffic dipped hard—time to rethink funnels.

### **Patterns?**

Short, funny, and technical *wins*. Social platforms crave video, while text-based blogs thrive on specificity and wit.

### **August Teasers**

Coming soon:

* More Artist Series (because surrealism is my spirit animal).
* More Testing Framework smackdowns (because nothing says summer fun like XML arguments).
* A sprinkle of automation: Zapier, Make, RPA robots—and maybe something Web3-ish for dessert.

### **A Shakespearean Summer Sonnet**

Shall I compare this July to a wilted rose?
It scorched with stats that seared my gentle brain.
Though TikTok’s tide in sudden favor rose,
The Facebook drought left arid fields of pain.

Yet hope doth bloom in August’s verdant green,
Where artist dreams and coders’ tests shall meet.
If fortune smiles, and graphs no longer lean,
We’ll trade our tears for sweeter data’s treat.

So fare thee well, O month of metric strife,
And bring me August, rich with views and life.

### **[Art Prompt](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=abstract-expressionism):**

A chaotic dance of molten reds and electric blues erupts across the canvas, with jagged strokes carving motion into stillness. Layers of thick impasto swirl in fierce arcs, colliding like tidal waves of color under a storm-lit sky. Stark, fractured shapes jut through a void of white, echoing tension and raw energy, as if sound itself were captured mid-roar.

### **[Video Prompt](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7534178113794739486):**

Animate a raging sea of color colliding in rhythmic pulses. Jagged crimson waves crash into streaks of cobalt blue as shards of white explode like lightning, then dissolve into slow, molten drips. Camera glides through this storm of hues, zooming into swirling textures that undulate to a deep, reverberating bassline.

* “New Jade” – Caribou
