Oh laughter, sweet sound of delight,  
You turn dark days into light.

Our joy begins,  
Making everything feel just right.

**Art Prompt:**
A surreal masterpiece depicting a vibrant comedy club in an intergalactic setting. The stage is lit by starlight, and the comedian is an alien with glowing, crystalline skin. The audience includes diverse extraterrestrial beings, each reacting in wildly exaggerated ways—from roaring with laughter to spilling their neon-hued drinks. The background reveals a cosmic view of swirling galaxies and asteroid belts, evoking both humor and wonder.
