# Conclusion of Eastern France: Colmar and Riquewihr, the Beauty and the Beast Village

If Alsace were a fairy tale, Colmar would be the grand opening page: canals framed by pastel half-timbered houses, cobblestones that echo under your feet, and flower boxes spilling over like a watercolor painting. Just a short drive away, Riquewihr steps in as the true “Beauty and the Beast” village — its winding streets and market square look like they were lifted straight from the film. Belle could have been singing about her “provincial town” right here, croissant in hand and book tucked under her arm.

## A Quick Stroll Through History

Colmar’s story begins in the 9th century, and by the Middle Ages it had risen as a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. Its place in Alsace meant it spent centuries bouncing between French and German rule, before finally settling as French after World War II. Today, it’s not only the wine capital of Alsace but also one of the best-preserved towns in Europe.

Riquewihr, on the other hand, blossomed as a fortified wine village in the 16th century. Miraculously, it escaped destruction in both World Wars, leaving its medieval walls and Renaissance-era houses untouched. The town’s preservation is so complete that walking through feels like tumbling back four centuries — or into a Disney storyboard.

## Who Lives Here Now?

Colmar is home to roughly 70,000 residents, a community shaped by French, Alsatian, and German roots. Tourism, wine production, and light manufacturing anchor its economy, with locals still proud of their Alsatian dialect.

Riquewihr is far smaller, with just over 1,000 residents, but it lives large through tourism. Its position along the Alsace Wine Route means wine cellars are as common as bakeries, and many families have been vintners for generations.

## What You Must See

* **In Colmar:**

  * *La Petite Venise (Little Venice):* canals lined with colorful homes, ideal for a gentle boat ride.
  * *Unterlinden Museum:* home to the Isenheim Altarpiece, an intense and unforgettable Renaissance work.
  * *Maison Pfister:* a 16th-century house that’s basically medieval Instagram material.

* **In Riquewihr:**

  * *The Market Square:* the heart of the “Beauty and the Beast” vibe, complete with fountain.
  * *The Dolder Tower:* the town’s medieval gatehouse and clock tower, proudly standing since 1291.
  * *Vineyard Views:* Riquewihr is wrapped in Riesling vines that slope dramatically down to the village.

## What You Must Eat

In both towns, Alsatian cuisine steals the show:

* **Choucroute garnie:** sauerkraut with sausages and pork, hearty enough to last you through winter.
* **Tarte flambée (flammekueche):** paper-thin dough layered with cream, onions, and bacon.
* **Kougelhopf:** a sweet, crown-shaped cake dusted with sugar, best with coffee.
  Pair it with a crisp Riesling or aromatic Gewürztraminer — you’re literally in the vineyards that produce them.

## The Statue of Liberty in Colmar

Colmar proudly claims Auguste Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty, as a native son. A 12-meter replica of Lady Liberty stands at the city’s northern entrance, facing west toward her twin in New York. While the Eiffel Tower belongs to Paris, Colmar’s Liberty cements the town’s unexpected connection to America.

## From Alsace to Germany

The German border lies just beyond the Rhine. Freiburg im Breisgau is under an hour away — a lively university town with Gothic spires and sunny plazas. Push further into the Black Forest, and you’ll find towering evergreens, Black Forest cake with scandalous amounts of cream, and cuckoo clocks ticking away louder than your smartwatch.

## Tidbits to Impress at Dinner

* Riquewihr is one of the few towns in Alsace that looks today almost exactly as it did in the 16th century.
* Colmar’s old town survived WWII almost entirely intact, sparing its medieval and Renaissance architecture.
* Alsace’s stork folklore remains alive: locals say babies are delivered by storks that nest on rooftops.
* The Alsace Wine Route, stretching 170 km, is France’s oldest official wine trail.

So whether you find yourself drifting through Colmar’s canals or weaving through Riquewihr’s market square, you’ll quickly realize: Alsace doesn’t just whisper fairy tales — it sings them.

A sweeping landscape of fractured planes and luminous tones, where figures blur into angular silhouettes against a backdrop of vibrant, prismatic shards. Streaks of cobalt and ochre clash with crimson bursts, while heavy impasto textures create a sense of urgency. Light seems to fracture into geometric rain, balancing chaos with harmony, as if the canvas itself were alive with restless energy.

Begin with slow pans across a fractured, geometric dreamscape where vibrant shards of cobalt and ochre shimmer like stained glass. Shift into dynamic camera sweeps as crimson bursts ripple outward, the textures pulsating in sync with the rhythm. The figures within the planes dissolve and reform, creating motion that feels like light breaking apart into color. Close with a zoom-out revealing the whole canvas alive, vibrating with restless harmony.
