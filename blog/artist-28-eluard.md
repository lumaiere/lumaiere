# Episode 28: Paul Éluard—The Surrealist Who Wrote Freedom on the Wind

[Paul Éluard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Eluard) didn’t just write poems—he slipped secret passwords into people’s pockets. Born Eugène Émile Paul Grindel in 1895, he helped invent [Surrealism’s](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/surrealism) voice, then turned that voice into a bullhorn for resistance. If the movement had dream mechanics, Éluard was the guy who left the escape hatch open.

**Who is this artist?**
A French poet and pillar of Surrealism. He was there for the wild early years with [André Breton](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/episode-23-andré-breton-the-guy-who-turned-daydreaming-into-a-job-description-63bae1a89ee1) and [Max Ernst](https://medium.com/@DaveLumAI/max-ernst-frottage-frogs-and-full-on-surrealist-weirdness-dcacf9649125), and later became a conscience for occupied France.

**What is he known for?**
Two big peaks: [Surrealist love-and-dream lyrics](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/paul-eluard) that made the subconscious feel like a furnished apartment, and “[Liberté](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=67&issue=1&page=18),” a resistance poem that became morale-boosting contraband during World War II.

**What is his style?**
Intimate, lucid, and dream-bright. He fused clear, simple language with oneiric leaps—love poems where doors open onto sky, and ordinary nouns quietly disobey gravity. His landmark book *Capitale de la douleur* paired tenderness with vertigo, a blueprint for elegant delirium.

**Who taught him?**
No single master. He read deeply (Apollinaire and beyond), found his tribe in the Surrealists, and sharpened his craft in that combustible lab of Breton, Ernst, [Aragon, Tzara](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68fe13affa7c81919810036b17570256) & co. Think less “pupil and teacher,” more steel meeting flint.

**Does he use any special technique?**
Surrealist methods galore: associative leaps, image juxtapositions, and collaborative experiments (including exquisite corpses and book-objects with artists). He often wrote in deceptively plain diction, making the strange land softly.

**Who has he worked with?**
Plenty of art-world Avengers:

* **Max Ernst** (illustrated collaborations like *Les Malheurs des immortels*)
* **Man Ray** (photo-text projects; see *Facile*, inspired by Nusch Éluard)
* **Pablo Picasso** (friendship & mutual admiration)
* And he once married **Gala**, who later became Salvador Dalí’s muse. The Surrealists kept it… complicated.

**Was he wealthy?**
Not particularly. He had periods of relative stability thanks to family support and publishing success, but he was a working poet, not a tycoon. Fame brought influence more than fortune.

**When was he most popular?**
Mid-1920s with *Capitale de la douleur* (1926) cemented his Surrealist stature; early–mid 1940s his wartime poetry (especially “Liberté”) made him a public voice far beyond the art crowd.

**Tell me more, please**

* **Nusch Éluard**, his second wife, was a crucial muse—appearing in Man Ray’s photos and haunting Éluard’s verse with calm electricity.
* He joined, left, and rejoined the French Communist Party as political winds and personal ethics shifted; the constant was his anti-fascist conviction.
* His clarity is his stealth: lines look simple on the surface, but the metaphors unfold like pocket universes. He could pivot from intimate love lyric to public hymn without losing his timbre.

**Anything else left to tell?**
Yes: “Liberté” wasn’t just printed—it was **air-dropped** as leaflets over occupied territory. Imagine your poem parachuting into history.

**Any other interesting tidbits?**

* His pen name “Éluard” came from his grandmother’s surname.
* He loved collaborative “livres d’artiste,” where poems and images tango on equal footing.
* He died in 1952; thousands attended his funeral—poetry as public ritual, not private whisper.

### [Art Prompt (Surrealist Collage):](https://lumaiere.com/?gallery=surrealism3)

A moonlit interior dissolves into an open seascape: long, velum-thin curtains breathe toward a horizon stitched with faint constellations; a white table floats slightly above a checkered floor, casting two shadows that refuse to intersect; paper feathers drift upward like reversed snowfall; a porcelain key lies half-submerged in a bowl of midnight; use cool grays, pale cerulean, and soft bone-white, with gentle, matte textures and quiet, balanced asymmetry; the atmosphere is serene, weightless, and slightly impossible.

### [Video Prompt:](https://www.tiktok.com/@davelumai/video/7565520237156715806)

Start on the checkered floor as its tiles ripple like water; tilt up to curtains that inhale and exhale, revealing the seascape beyond; slow push toward the levitating table while paper feathers rise in gentle spirals; cut to a close-up of the porcelain key rocking in a dark bowl, sending tiny concentric waves; final pullback merges room and coast into one continuous space; loop seamlessly by letting the curtains close and reopen to the first frame.

**Song pairings for the edit (fresh picks):**

* “Le temps de l’amour” – Françoise Hardy
* “Heroes” – David Bowie
