**1. The Literal Listener**

*Teacher:* "Why are you doing your math multiplication on the floor?"

*Student:* "You told me not to use tables."

**2. Culinary Confusion**

*Mom:* "What are you drawing?"

*Child:* "A picture of our family."

*Mom:* "Why am I in the kitchen?"

*Child:* "Because you can't cook."

**3. The Honest Artist**

*Dad:* "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

*Child:* "An artist."

*Dad:* "That's wonderful! What kind of art will you make?"

*Child:* "Abstract. That way, no one can say it's wrong."

**4. The Future Planner**

*Mom:* "What are you thinking about?"

*Child:* "My wedding."

*Mom:* "Oh? Who are you marrying?"

*Child:* "I don't know yet, but they better like pizza."

**5. The Literal Thinker**

*Teacher:* "If I gave you two cats and another two cats and another two, how many would you have?"

*Student:* "Seven."

*Teacher:* "No, listen carefully... If I gave you two cats, and another two cats, and another two, how many would you have?"

*Student:* "Seven."

*Teacher:* "Let me put it to you differently. If I gave you two apples, and another two apples, and another two, how many would you have?"

*Student:* "Six."

*Teacher:* "Good. Now, if I gave you two cats, and another two cats, and another two, how many would you have?"

*Student:* "Seven!"

*Teacher:* "Where do you get seven from?!"

*Student:* "Because I already have a cat!"

**A Limerick to Lighten the Mood**

There once was a child so bright,

Who thought stars were holes in the night.

He tried with all might,

To turn off their light,

But found they were stuck on too tight.
