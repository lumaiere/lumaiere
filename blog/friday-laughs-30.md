# Lunar Laughs That Crash and Burn

Some people can’t find the Man in the Moon, and then there’s me—failing spectacularly at cracking jokes about not finding him. It’s like I’m the punchline astronaut, floating in a void of bad timing and cosmic flops. So, let’s ditch the telescope and zoom in on my epic misfires—because if you can’t laugh at the moon, laugh at me bombing harder than a meteor shower!

I tried joking about not seeing the Man in the Moon, but my friend said, “Stick to your day job.” I said, “What day job? I’m a night-shift comedian who just got eclipsed!”

I told my wife I’d make a hilarious quip about the invisible lunar guy. She waited, then said, “Was that it?” Nope, just me forgetting the punchline like it’s lost in orbit.

I attempted a moon joke at a party—something about him hiding in plain sight. Everyone stared blankly. Turns out I mumbled it so bad they thought I was reciting a grocery list. (Credit to my cousin for calling it “lunar laryngitis.”)

I texted my buddy: “Why can’t I see the Man in the Moon?” He replied, “Because your jokes are so bad he’s hiding from *you*.” Ouch, roasted by my own setup!

I pitched a moonless gag to my mom: “He’s not there because…” I blanked. She patted my head and said, “It’s okay, dear, comedy’s not for everyone.” Thanks, Mom, I’ll just go cry in the dark now.

There once was a joker named Fred,  
Whose moon jokes all fell flat and dead,  
He’d stammer and stall,  
No laughs came at all,  
So he blamed the shy moon overhead.

I tried a one-liner about the Man in the Moon’s no-show streak. “He’s just…” Crickets. My dog tilted his head like, “Even I could’ve fetched a better finish than that!”

Here’s my poetic apology for these duds:  
My jokes aimed for stars but hit dirt,  
The moon’s MIA, I’m inert,  
With a giggle or groan,  
I’m a laughless drone,  
But I’ll keep bombing—hope it won’t hurt!

Art Prompt:  
A bustling outdoor scene unfolds under a golden afternoon sun, painted with swift, impressionistic strokes akin to Renoir’s lively hand. Figures in flowing dresses and dapper suits mingle across a sun-dappled lawn, their forms softened by feathery dabs of rose, azure, and ochre. A table groans with vivid fruits and pastries, their colors popping against a creamy cloth rendered in thick, creamy impasto. Light filters through quivering leaves overhead, casting playful shadows that dance across the canvas in loose, rhythmic patterns.
