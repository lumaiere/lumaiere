**Why Can’t I See the Man in the Moon? Are We Being Ghosted?**  

They say the moon is a harsh mistress, but I think she’s just bad at returning texts. Every time I look up, I expect to see the Man in the Moon, but all I get is a big ol’ cratered ghosting. So, let’s dive into some lunar mysteries with a set of jokes that’ll make you howl like a werewolf at a full moon.

I tried to find the Man in the Moon, but all I got was a restraining order from NASA.

Why doesn’t the Man in the Moon have any friends?  
Because every time he tries to hang out, people just stare awkwardly at him from Earth.

I asked the moon where its man was.  
It said, “I don’t know, last I checked, he was *phasing* out.”

Why is the Man in the Moon never seen at night?  
Because he only does matinees.

I called the Man in the Moon, but he said he was *over the world’s drama*.

If the Man in the Moon is real, then why does my telescope history suggest I was just looking at cheese?

I finally saw the Man in the Moon!  
Wait, never mind. That was just my neighbor flashing a flashlight at my window.

“I don’t blink, I just spy—  
And Earth folks are loony at noon.”

**Art Prompt:**  
A breathtaking impressionist painting of a serene Parisian street at dusk, bathed in golden lamplight and the fading warmth of a sunset. Loose, dreamy brushstrokes capture the blurred movement of elegant pedestrians strolling past lively cafes, where warm candlelight spills onto cobblestone pathways. The reflections of city lights shimmer on the rain-kissed streets, and the silhouette of a violinist playing a melancholic tune adds a touch of romantic nostalgia. The scene is infused with a soft glow, creating a timeless, dreamlike atmosphere reminiscent of Monet’s ethereal cityscapes.
