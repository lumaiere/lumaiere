# The Man in the Moon Is Playing Hide and Seek Again

Look, I don’t know who told the Man in the Moon he’s good at hide and seek, but I’ve been squinting at the sky for years and I’m starting to think he’s either a master of disguise or just a no-show. Maybe he’s got a gig as a nightlight somewhere else, leaving us with a cosmic game of “Where’s Waldo?” minus the stripes. Either way, it’s time to roast this lunar Houdini with some laughs that’ll make you forget he’s ghosting us.

I told my friend I couldn’t see the Man in the Moon. He said, “Maybe he’s just shy.” I said, “Shy? The guy’s got a whole crater spotlight and he’s still pulling a wallflower act!” (Credit to my buddy Steve for that one—he’s funnier than me when he’s not sober.)

My kid asked why we can’t see the Man in the Moon every night. I said, “Because he’s got a side hustle selling glow-in-the-dark cheese to aliens.” Kid’s still mad I didn’t bring him some.

I tried using a telescope to find the Man in the Moon, but all I got was a blurry dot. Turns out he’s not hiding—he’s just really bad at posing for selfies.

I asked my grandma why the Man in the Moon disappears sometimes. She said, “Oh, he’s probably napping behind a cloud.” Great, now I’m jealous of a guy who gets to snooze on the job and still looks crater-ific.

I heard the Man in the Moon’s been dodging us because he’s embarrassed about his acne scars. I yelled up, “Dude, own it—those craters are just cosmic dimples!”

There once was a lunar man, Jack,  
Whose face hid in shadows so black,  
He’d duck out of sight,  
Every half of the night,  
Leaving stargazers lost and off track.

I told my dog we’d hunt for the Man in the Moon together. He barked at the sky for an hour, then gave me a look like, “You’re an idiot, it’s just a big frisbee up there.” (Inspired by Rover’s existential crisis, credit to him.)

Why’d the Man in the Moon stop showing up? He heard we were planning a roast and he couldn’t handle the heat—guess he’s more of a cold rock kinda guy.

Here’s a little ditty to wrap things up:  
The Moon’s got a man, or so they say,  
But he’s dodging us night and day,  
With a wink and a grin,  
He’s too shy to begin,  
So we’ll laugh ‘til he comes out to play!

Art Prompt:  
A serene landscape captures a fleeting moment at dusk, painted with loose, vibrant brushstrokes reminiscent of Monet’s fluid style. Golden sunlight dances across a rippling river, flanked by lush, emerald reeds swaying in a gentle breeze. Soft pinks and purples bleed into the sky, reflecting on the water’s surface in shimmering, broken hues. Distant trees, mere silhouettes, fade into a hazy horizon, their edges softened by thick, textured layers of oil paint applied with a palette knife. The scene hums with quiet energy, each stroke alive with movement and light.
